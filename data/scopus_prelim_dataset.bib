abstract={The rumen is a unique natural habitat, exhibiting an unparalleled genetic resource of fibrolytic enzymes of microbial origin that degrade plant polysaccharides. The objectives of this study were to identify the principal plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and the taxonomic profile of rumen microbial communities that are associated with it. The cattle rumen microflora and the carbohydrate-active enzymes were functionally classified through a whole metagenomic sequencing approach. Analysis of the assembled sequences by the Carbohydrate-active enzyme a﻿nalysis Toolkit identified the candidate genes encoding fibrolytic enzymes belonging to different classes of glycoside hydrolases(11,010 contigs), glycosyltransferases (6366 contigs), carbohydrate esterases (4945 contigs), carbohydrate-binding modules (1975 contigs), polysaccharide lyases (480 contigs), and auxiliary activities (115 contigs). Phylogenetic analysis of CAZyme encoding contigs revealed that a significant proportion of CAZymes were contributed by bacteria belonging to genera Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. The results indicated that the cattle rumen microbiome and the CAZymes are highly complex, structurally similar but compositionally distinct from other ruminants. The unique characteristics of rumen microbiota and the enzymes produced by resident microbes provide opportunities to improve the feed conversion efficiency in ruminants and serve as a reservoir of industrially important enzymes for cellulosic biofuel production. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The knowledge of the genetic architecture of closely related species and/or populations of a single species can be very useful to shed light on the processes that led to their current distributions. The present study provides a preliminary evaluation of the conservation status of the populations of Cryptotaenia thomasii, a very narrow endemic species occurring in southern Italy. Previous studies showed that C. thomasii was phylogenetically closely related to C. flahaultii, endemic species of Caucasus, and to evaluate its conservation status and the genetic variability of plant species the internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced and the SNPs were analyzed. Results: The restriction analysis of nrDNA with the restriction enzymes allowed to detect the presence of two single mutations (SNPs) among the sequences of two species. Our molecular analysis pointed out that C. thomasii and C. flahaultii, in spite of their geographical disjunction, show a sign of an ancient contact as an extreme case of geographical disjunction Italian-Caucasus. Conclusion: From the evolutionary history of the species and its distribution pattern one can reconstruct a possible scenario with some hypotheses that explain the hypothetical ancestral area where the two species were in contact. We speculate the two species may have originated from fragmentation of a common ancestor widespread in the Western Palearctic zone and have survived in two separated refuge areas limited by important mountain systems. This hypothesis is supported by our molecular analysis, in fact, the analysis of SNPs showed that some C. thomasii populations retain the signs of an ancient link with C. flahaultii. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Genetically engineered crops with insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been planted in the world for two decades, aiming to control some major insect pests. While the Bt-crop strategy has been generally successful, a potential risk is the evolution of insect resistance to Bt crops. Modeling has been one of the main approaches to assessing the risk. To date, however, the importance of spatial heterogeneity in small-holder farm systems has not been adequately addressed. To address the question we developed and analyzed a spatially explicit model of insect population dynamics and genetics in which the proportion of Bt crops (PBt) is spatially heterogeneous (HD) or homogeneous (UD). We found that in both single- and two-locus models, the time it takes for insect to evolve regional resistance (TTR) varies among different HD patterns. The TTR could differ considerably between the case of HD and that of UD, depending on both spatial and non-spatial conditions. Under some conditions, regional evolution of resistance was much faster in the case of HD than in the case of UD. The difference between the two cases was caused by gene spread from hotspots of resistant alleles where the local PBt is much higher than average. Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of PBt may significantly affect the speed of regional resistance and therefore is an important factor that should be taken into account for quantitative predictions as well as for design of resistance management strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. We investigated the physiology of two transgenic P. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern USA: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier Piedmont site. Our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. Lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. Significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15–25% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. In the Piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50–70% relative to wildtype. Transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. Surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems – lower water consumption. In the hottest month (July), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d−1 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. Decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in Populus. © 2017},

abstract={During the past decade, the use of DNA for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. Tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. These approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. Often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as “country of origin”. In this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. This method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. We demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. One set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120 km by 120 km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 SNPs, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the African tropical tree species Entandrophragma cylindricum (Sapelli) genotyped at 61 SNPs. Judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and Bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5–7% for the Sapelli data set. Our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Sucrose is a key metabolite in guard cell (GC) regulation and has been proposed to form a key metabolic connection between mesophyll cells and GCs. However, the importance of sucrose transport across the GC plasma membrane in stomatal movements remains to be determined. Here, we characterized transgenic tobacco plants expressing an antisense gene construct for the SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 1 (SUT1) driven by the GC specific promoter KST1. GCs of transgenic plants contained less sucrose, more starch and had increases in K+ content. Lower GC sucrose content was associated with lower stomatal conductance that, in turn, led to a lower transpiration rate and higher carbon isotope composition ratio compared to wild type plants. Although the transgenic plants showed reduced growth under optimal water supply condition, they showed improved growth compared to wild type plants under osmotic stress and demonstrated lower water consumption that was correlated with higher relative water content under water-deficit conditions. This demonstrates the desiccation postponement phenotype of these plants together with an improved tolerance to water deficit. Taken together, our results indicate that SUT1 has an important role in stomatal movements and suggest that genetic manipulation of GC sucrose transport could be used to obtain plants with greater water use efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An efficient simple in vitro plant regeneration system was established for Begonia homonyma, a threatened ornamental and medicinal plant. Shoot multiplication was improved significantly with a concomitant decrease in shoot length from leaf explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 15 μM benzyladenine (BA) and 5 μM naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Shoots were established further in MS medium with reduced concentrations of BA and NAA. Shoots exhibited an high frequency of necrosis. The highest numbers of shoots (37.2 per explant, 44.0 mm) were obtained from shoot explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with 5 μM gibberellic acid (GA3) and 0.5 μM BA. Necrosis of shoots (10%) was controlled by using half-strength MS medium containing 2 μM GA3 and 0.5 μM BA for shoot explants derived from culture medium supplemented with 2 μM meta-topolin riboside (mTR) and 0.5 μM NAA. Rooting of shoots was effective in MS medium supplemented with 15 g L− 1 sucrose, 2 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 0.5 μM NAA, while root elongation was best with a combination of 2 μM IBA and 0.5 μM phloroglucinol. All plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the greenhouse. The reported organogenesis systems reinforced the importance of hormonal, sucrose and phloroglucinol effects on in vitro plant regeneration. Organogenesis protocols described here provide systems for a conservation strategy, ex vitro gene bank and commercial planting, and for genetic transformation studies. © 2017 SAAB},

abstract={Plants tolerate large variations in the intensity of the light environment by controlling the efficiency of solar to chemical energy conversion. To do this, plants have a mechanism to detect the intensity, duration, and change in light as they experience moving shadows, flickering light, and cloud cover. Sugars are the primary products of CO2 fixation, a metabolic pathway that is rate limited by this solar energy conversion. We propose that sugar is a signal encoding information about the intensity, duration and change in the light environment. We previously showed that the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex including its receptor-like Regulator of G signaling protein, AtRGS1, detects both the concentration and the exposure time of sugars (Fu et al., 2014. Cell 156: 1084–1095). This unique property, designated dose-duration reciprocity, is a behavior that emerges from the system architecture / system motif. Here, we show that another property of the signaling system is to detect large changes in light while at the same time, filtering types of fluctuation in light that do not affect photosynthesis efficiency. When AtRGS1 is genetically ablated, photosynthesis efficiency is reduced in a changing- but not a constant-light environment. Mathematical modeling revealed that information about changes in the light environment is encoded in the amount of free AtRGS1 that becomes compartmentalized following stimulation. We propose that this property determines when to adjust photosynthetic efficiency in an environment where light intensity changes abruptly caused by moving shadows on top of a background of light changing gradually from sun rise to sun set and fluctuating light such as that caused by fluttering leaves. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A salient feature of flowering plant diversification is the emergence of a novel suite of floral features coinciding with the origin of the most species-rich lineage, Pentapetalae. Advances in phylogenetics, developmental genetics and genomics, including new analyses presented here, are helping to reconstruct the specific evolutionary steps involved in the evolution of this clade. The enormous floral diversity among Pentapetalae appears to be built on a highly conserved ground plan of five-parted (pentamerous) flowers with whorled phyllotaxis. By contrast, lability in the number and arrangement of component parts of the flower characterize the early-diverging eudicot lineages subtending Pentapetalae. The diversification of Pentapetalae also coincides closely with ancient hexaploidy, referred to as the gamma whole-genome triplication, for which the phylogenetic timing, mechanistic details and molecular evolutionary consequences are as yet not fully resolved. Transcription factors regulating floral development often persist in duplicate or triplicate in gamma-derived genomes, and both individual genes andwhole transcriptional programmes exhibit a shift from broadly overlapping to tightly defined expression domains in Pentapetalae flowers. Investigations of these changes associated with the origin of Pentapetalae can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of what is arguably one of the most important evolutionary diversification events within terrestrial plants. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. Recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. In the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. In the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophyteswere an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. Reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. The data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={A major challenge is to understand how conserved gene regulatory networks control the wonderful diversity of form that we see among animals and plants. Butterfly wing patterns are an excellent example of this diversity. Butterfly wings form as imaginal discs in the caterpillar and are constructed by a gene regulatory network, much of which is conserved across the holometabolous insects. Recent work in Heliconius butterflies takes advantage of genomic approaches and offers insights into how the diversification of wing patterns is overlaid onto this conserved network. WntA is a patterning morphogen that alters spatial information in the wing. Optix is a transcription factor that acts later in development to paint specific wing regions red. Both of these loci fit the paradigm of conserved protein-coding loci with diverse regulatory elements and developmental roles that have taken on novel derived functions in patterning wings. These discoveries offer insights into the ‘Nymphalid Ground Plan’, which offers a unifying hypothesis for pattern formation across nymphalid butterflies. These loci also represent ‘hotspots’ for morphological change that have been targeted repeatedly during evolution. Both convergent and divergent evolution of a great diversity of patterns is controlled by complex alleles at just a few genes. We suggest that evolutionary change has become focused on one or a few genetic loci for two reasons. First, pre-existing complex cisregulatory loci that already interact with potentially relevant transcription factors are more likely to acquire novel functions in wing patterning. Second, the shape of wing regulatory networks may constrain evolutionary change to one or a few loci. Overall, genomic approaches that have identified wing patterning loci in these butterflies offer broad insight into how gene regulatory networks evolve to produce diversity. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Gene flow in plant populations is heavily affected by species sexual systems. In order to study the effect of sexual systems on genetic structure, we examined plastid and nuclear DNA of 12 dioecious (males and females) and 18 trioecious (males, females and hermaphrodites) populations of Salix myrsinifolia—a boreal shrub with slow range expansion. Populations were located along latitudinal gradients across submarginal and marginal parts of the range. Individuals of each sex morph were all hexaploid. We identified 10 chloroplast DNA haplotypes and scored 205 polymorphic bands with amplified fragment length polymorphism. We found dioecious populations that differed from trioecious populations via the presence of four unique haplotypes and significant difference in Nei’s gene diversity index (0.119 vs. 0.116) and down-weighed marker value (1.17 vs. 1.02). The latter parameter, together with haplotype and nucleotide diversity, significantly decreased with latitude similar to the expansion front. Also, we found that 89% of hermaphrodite individuals belong to one distinct in tree parsimony network haplotype. This frequency significantly decreased with latitude towards the expansion front. We suspect that the presence of hermaphrodites in trioecious populations may represent a trade-off between the possibility of producing progeny by single hermaphrodites and genetic variability loss through autogamy. S. myrsinifolia benefits from trioecious sexual systems under colonization events. This phenomenon is no longer a gain closer to the core of the species range. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Plant development requires specific cells to be eliminated in a predictable and genetically regulated manner referred to as programmed cell death (PCD). However, the target cells do not merely die but they also undergo autolysis to degrade their cellular corpses. Recent progress in understanding developmental cell elimination suggests that distinct proteins execute PCD sensu stricto and autolysis. In addition, cell death alone and cell dismantlement can fulfill different functions. Hence, it appears biologically meaningful to distinguish between the modules of PCD and autolysis during plant development. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), i.e. small, non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in morphological characters, increases under genetic and/or environmental stress. Ecological and evolutionary studies addressing FA became popular in past decades; however, their outcomes remain controversial. The discrepancies might be at least partly explained by inconsistent and non-standardised methodology. Our aim was to improve the methodology of these studies by identifying factors that affect the reproducibility of FA measurements in plant leaves. Six observers used a highly standardised measurement protocol to measure FA using the width, area and weight of the same set of leaves of 10 plant species that differed in leaf size, shape of the leaf margin and other leaf traits. On average, 24% of the total variation in the data was due to measurement error. Reproducibility of measurements varied with the shape of leaf margin, leaf size, the measured character and the experience of the observer. The lowest reproducibility of the width of leaf halves was found for simple leaves with serrate margins and the highest for simple leaves with entire margins and for compound pinnate leaves. The reproducibility was significantly lower for the weight of leaf halves than for either their width or area, especially for plants with small leaves. The reproducibility was also lower for measurements made by experienced observers than by naïve observers. The size of press-dried leaves decreased slightly but significantly relative to fresh leaves, but the FA of press-dried leaves adequately reflected the FA of fresh leaves. In contrast, preservation in 60% ethanol did not affect leaf size, but it decreased the width-based values of FA to 89.3% of the values measured from fresh leaves. We suggest that although reproducibility of leaf FA measurements depends upon many factors, the shape of the leaf margin is the most important source of variation. We recommend, whenever possible, choosing large-leaved plants with entire leaf margins as model objects for studies involving measurements of FA using the width of leaf halves. These measurements should be conducted with high accuracy from images of fresh or press-dried leaves. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As the first step of ongoing efforts to investigate the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins in the medicinal plant Ornithogalum caudatum, this investigation reported the cDNA isolation, prokaryotic expression and functional characterization of squalene synthase (SQS) gene from O. caudatum for the first time. Specifically, two unigenes showing high sequence identity to SQS were retrieved from RNA-Taq data, and then a full-length OcSQS1 corresponding to the two unigenes was isolated from O. caudatum genome by a nested PCR assay. The open reading frame of OcSQS1 was 1230 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 409 aa. OcSQS1 was predicted to be a membrane-bound protein with at least four conserved motifs associated with binding, regulatory and catalytic activities of OcSQS1 and two transmembrane domains. Next, many attempts to generate soluble OcSQS1 in heterologous Escherichia coli were made, including optimization of expression conditions, application of varied expression plasmids with different tags, secretory peptides and molecular chaperones, and truncated mutation of OcSQS1. Finally, the successful availability of a soluble, truncated OcSQS1 mutant was achieved by combinational use of the utensils from the vast genetic toolbook. Moreover, this truncated OcSQS1 mutant retained the folding capability as well as its catalytic activity, converting FPP to form squalene. Importantly, the present research tentatively verified the involvement of the second transmembrane domain in the proper folding of the recombinant OcSQS1 protein. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A collection of 102 Diaporthe isolates was compiled from lesions on carrot, parsley and wild Apiaceae species in France from 2010 to 2014. Molecular typing based on ITS rDNA sequences resulted in the identification of 85 D. angelicae and 17 D. eres isolates. Based on sequences of the 3′ part of the IGS rDNA, intraspecific variability was analysed for 17 D. angelicae and 13 D. eres isolates from diverse plant species, locations in France, and plant tissues. The genetic diversity was greater for D. angelicae isolates than D. eres isolates. In vitro sensitivity of five D. angelicae and four D. eres isolates to each of nine fungicides was similar for isolates of both species, with a marked variation in fungicide sensitivity depending on the active ingredient. To assess the pathogenicity of D. angelicae and D. eres isolates on carrot, one isolate of each species was inoculated onto umbels in a controlled environment. Typical lesions were observed for both isolates. Carrot crop debris collected from a seed production field in France and placed in controlled conditions produced perithecia and ascospores typical of Diaporthe, that were further characterized molecularly as belonging to D. angelicae. Detection of Diaporthe species on seed lots from three carrot production fields in France was investigated. Both species were detected on seeds by conventional PCR assay, with a greater frequency for D. angelicae than D. eres (67% vs 33%, respectively). Overall, the results highlighted that umbel browning in carrot seed crops in France was mainly caused by D. angelicae. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology},

abstract={This is the first genetic study reporting on the interaction and molecular mapping of resistance to the barley grass stripe rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei, Psph) in common wheat. Seedlings of 638 wheat accessions were tested and it was determined that wheat is a near-nonhost to Psph based on rare susceptibility observed in <2% of commercial cultivars and <5% of wheat landraces. As previously observed for P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the Australian cultivar Teal was highly susceptible to Psph. In contrast, a selection of cv. Avocet carrying complementary resistance genes Yr73 and Yr74 (Avocet R; AvR) was resistant. The Teal × AvR (T/A) doubled haploid (DH) population was used to map resistance in AvR to Psph. Infection types on the T/A DH lines inoculated with Psph and Pst indicated that all DH lines carrying both Yr73 and Yr74 were also resistant to Psph; however, fewer DH lines were susceptible to Psph than expected, suggesting the resistance was more complex. QTL analysis using 9053 DArT-Seq markers determined that resistance to Psph was polygenically inherited and mapped to chromosomes 3A, 3D, 4A and 5B. The 3DL and 5BL markers co-located with Yr73 and Yr74, suggesting an overlap between host and non-host resistance mechanisms. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology},

The Jaccard’s dissimilarity coefficient ranged from 0.17 to 0.80. Based on the neighbour joining method of clustering, accessions were grouped into six major clusters congruent with their respective geographical locations. The mean values of effective multiplex ratio, polymorphic information content, marker index and resolving power were 34.83, 0.286, 9.700 and 14.29 respectively. In addition, a core collection consisting of 20 accessions was identified. Population STRUCTURE analysis produced the highest log likelihood score when the number of populations (K) was set at 2, which was not consistent with clustering analysis based on genetic diversity.

abstract={Background Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the chloroplast enzyme that fixes CO2 in photosynthesis, but the enzyme also fixes O2, which leads to the wasteful photorespiratory pathway. If we better understand the structure-function relationship of the enzyme, we might be able to engineer improvements. When the crystal structure of Chlamydomonas Rubisco was solved, four new posttranslational modifications were observed which are not present in other species. The modifications were 4-hydroxylation of the conserved Pro-104 and 151 residues, and S-methylation of the variable Cys-256 and 369 residues, which are Phe-256 and Val-369 in land plants. Because the modifications were only observed in Chlamydomonas Rubisco, they might account for the differences in kinetic properties between the algal and plant enzymes. Methods Site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation have been used to test the essentiality of these modifications by replacing each of the residues with alanine (Ala). Biochemical analyses were done to determine the specificity factors and kinetic constants. Results Replacing the modified-residues in Chlamydomonas Rubisco affected the enzyme's catalytic activity. Substituting hydroxy-Pro-104 and methyl-Cys-256 with alanine influenced Rubisco catalysis. Conclusion This is the first study on these posttranslationally-modified residues in Rubisco by genetic engineering. As these forms of modifications/regulation are not available in plants, the modified residues could be a means to modulate Rubisco activity. General significance With a better understanding of Rubisco structure-function, we can define targets for improving the enzyme. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Population genetic studies of plant species can contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of the Brazilian Cerrado, a highly threatened hotspot and the richest tropical savanna in the world. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the diversity and genetic structure of Byrsonima coccolobifolia (Malpighiaceae), one of the most common tree species in the Brazilian Cerrado, focusing mainly on the central area of the biome. This is a bird-dispersed species, and studies targeting species with this seed dispersal syndrome are scarce. First, we performed a careful screening of cpDNA markers to identify regions suitable for intraspecific genetic studies, and then we investigated the diversity and genetic structure in ten populations of B. coccolobifolia. The cpDNA regions selected (trnS-trnG and trnH-trnK) revealed considerable divergence among populations and a striking geographical structure, separating populations in two groups, east and west. Although seed dispersal by birds is expected to reach long distances, our results strongly corroborate studies targeting trees with limited seed dispersal. This suggests that historical fragmentation of Cerrado (possibly during cold and dry periods of the Quaternary) might have limited long distance dispersal events after climate amelioration even in bird-dispersed species, especially while Cerrado was expanding but still fragmented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The greatest challenge to the modern plant systematist is the interpretation of molecular phylogenies that do not correspond to previous classifications based on morphological data. Characters that on first appearance seem highly diagnostic are brought into focus by phylogeny and frequently shown to have evolved multiple times independently. Parallelism is usually neglected in such systematic studies and the homoplastic distribution of a character in a phylogeny is commonly accredited to convergent evolution. The impact of parallel evolution on angiosperm systematics is examined here using a taxonomically complex and species-rich group of tropical tree genera (Myrcia, Marlierea, Calyptranthes; Myrtaceae) as a case study. These groups are traditionally distinguished by flower characters and have been shown to be polyphyletic by molecular data. Floral ontogeny of distinct lineages is examined using SEM and plotted on a five gene phylogenetic hypothesis to estimate ancestral states and phylogenetic signal for developmental variation. Results show that floral characters responsible for taxonomic confusion are a result of both parallel evolution and convergence. This is contrasted with other diverse and taxonomically complex angiosperm groups and problematic taxonomy appears linked to recent diversification events where the same genetic basis remains latent, demonstrating parallelism to be an important factor in problematic taxonomies. In this study, variations in early stage floral development produce the most labile characters. This is discussed in light of ontogenetic patterns in angiosperms with focus on the evolutionary consequences of homoplastic variation during early vs late floral development. The prevalence of parallelism must be appreciated by taxonomists of complex groups. Future classifications of groups affected by parallelism are likely to require data from detailed, multi-disciplinary studies of key characters to interpret phylogenies correctly. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide in the dead plant biomass, and its degradation is an important part of global carbon cycle. β-Glucosidases complete the final step of cellulose hydrolysis by converting cellobiose to glucose. Genetic potential and expression of β-glucosidase genes were studied in the topsoil of a Picea abies forest in two contrasting seasons. These seasons were the summer, representing the peak of plant photosynthetic activity, and late winter, after an extended period with no photosynthate input. Fungal and bacterial β-glucosidase genes belonging to glycoside hydrolase families GH1 and GH3 amplified from DNA and RNA and amplicon pools were analyzed. Transcript pool were largely corresponded to gene pools, although some abundant transcripts were not found in the gene pool. The major reservoirs of β-glucosidase genes were the fungal phylum Ascomycota and Basidiomycota and the bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria Acidobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus. This indicates that a diverse microbial community utilized cellobiose. Seasonality influenced both genetic diversity of β-glucosidase genes and their expression. The results indicate that a complex community of bacteria and fungi expresses β-glucosidases in forest soils. Even β-glucosidase genes showing low abundance in DNA may be functionally important as revealed by their high expression especially in basidiomycota. The functional diversity in the studied ecosystem clearly exhibited a seasonal pattern. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) in South Africa has been extensively investigated for its phenomenal angiosperm diversity. A key emergent pattern is the occurrence of older plant lineages in the southern Fynbos biome and younger lineages in the northern Succulent Karoo biome. We know practically nothing, however, about the evolutionary history of the animals that pollinate this often highly-specialized flora. In this study, we explore the evolutionary history of an important GCFR fly pollinator, Megapalpus capensis, and ask whether it exhibits broadly congruent genetic structuring and timing of diversification to flowering plants within these biomes. We find that the oldest M. capensis lineages originated in Fynbos during the Miocene, while younger Succulent Karoo lineages diverged in the Pliocene and correspond to the proposed age of this recent biome. A strong signature of population expansion is also recovered for flies in this arid biome, consistent with recent colonization. Our first investigation into the evolutionary history of GCFR pollinators thus supports a recent origin of the SK biome, as inferred from angiosperm phylogenies, and suggests that plants and pollinators may have co-diverged within this remarkable area. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Based on RAPD and ISSR markers, at the inter-population level, effective number of alleles, Nei’s gene diversity and Shannon’s information index values were 1.46, 0.28, 0.44 and 1.50, 0.28, 0.41, respectively. As inferred using flow cytometry, the genome size varied between 2.59 ± 0.03 pg (cultivar of Assam) to 2.95 ± 0.04 pg (cultivar of Meghalaya) with a 1.14-fold variation.

abstract={Drought is a key factor that has historically affected maize productivity. Thus, retrospective studies of the performance of cultivars used in China under water- limited conditions may provide some useful information and guidance for the improvement of maize yield. The objectives of the present study were to assess genetic gains in grain yield and the trends in related secondary traits, particularly increased drought-stress tolerance, in cultivars widely used in China from the 1950s to the 2000s. Trials were conducted at two locations (Sanya and Urumchi) under two water regimes per location during the 2010–2011 growing seasons. Results indicated that mean grain yield showed a significant linear increase from the 1950s to the 2000s, and that newer maize cultivars yielded more than older ones under either drought stress or fully irrigated treatments. The average yield gains under water-limited and unstressed environments were 62.6 and 100.3 kg ha−1 yr−1 respectively. Secondary traits associated with drought in maize have been improved over the past 50 years. The ASI and empty ear rate both decreased, while kernels per ear and weight per 100 kernels increased. The latter two parameters were the main sources of yield gain from 1950 to 2000 under drought stress treatment. To further improve yield under drought-stress conditions, the ASI and empty ear rate should both continue to be decreased during maize breeding. Further, genotypes with plant height and ear traits that are less affected by drought stress should be selected. © 2016},

abstract={1. Adapting to a low-quality plant may require modification of an insect's digestive physiology, oviposition behaviour, or other host-use traits. If colonising a marginal host entails a cost, a decay in adaptation would be expected after selection is relaxed, i.e. if populations on a novel host are reverted to their high-quality ancestral host. 2. Replicate lines of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) rapidly adapted to lentil seeds; larval survival rose from approximately 1 to ≥ 90%, and oviposition on lentil increased more than two-fold. This study compared egg-laying behaviour in lines that either remained on lentil or were reverted to the ancestral host, mung bean, for 22–62 generations. 3. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, females from two reverted sublines showed decreased oviposition on lentil (estimated as lifetime fecundity), but host acceptance in a third subline was unchanged. In a short-term assay, acceptance of lentil by newly emerged females was lower in each reverted subline than in the corresponding non-reverted one. Because effective population sizes (determined from genome resequencing) were large throughout the experiment, this decline in host acceptance is unlikely to be explained solely by genetic drift. 4. Variation among replicates in the magnitude of the reversion effect was also observed in a previous study of larval survival. However, the pattern of variation for survival was not congruent with the pattern of variation for host acceptance in this study. Thus, genes mediating improved performance on lentil appear to be largely independent of those responsible for increased oviposition. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={New Phytologist 178 (2008), 503–514 Since the publication of Sanabria et al. (), it has been brought to our attention that a short section of text in this article replicates text that first appeared in an article authored by June Nasrallah (2015, p. 417). The sections in question are on p. 508 of Sanabria et al. and are replicated below, with quotation marks and correct attribution included. We apologize to our readers and to Professor Nasrallah for these errors. Corrected text section, p. 508 Parallels exist where plant SI and plant immunity have similar outcomes, such as the elimination of undesirable cells or organisms. Nasrallah (, p. 417) states: ‘both immunity and at least some SI systems (the crucifer and possibly the poppy systems) use highly variable receptors to recognize highly variable ligands. In addition, SI systems that have biodestructive activity towards pollen tubes use components that are also used in defense. For example, programmed cell death and other reactions triggered in the incompatible pollen tubes of poppy are also induced during the plant immune response’ (see also Jordan et al., Dangl & Jones, Geitmann et al., Thomas & Franklin-Tong,). Nasrallah (, p. 417) notes that ‘Another example relates to the nature of SCR/SP11, the pollen determinant of SI specificity in crucifers. SCR/SP11 is similar in structure (Mishima et al., Chookajorn et al.,) although not in primary sequence, to defensins, the molecules of innate immunity that present a first line of defense to microbial challenge in plants and animals. … the similarity between the two classes of molecules suggests an evolutionary link, albeit a distant one, between crucifer SI and innate immunity.’ The most notable parallels, however, emerge from comparisons of the self-recognition loci and genes of plant SI with those that control self/nonself recognition in a variety of recognition systems, the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in particular (Janeway & Medzhitov,). As outlined by Nasrallah (, p. 417) ‘in both plants and animals, and from immunity to reproduction, self/nonself discrimination systems have been molded by similar selective pressures for diversification and coevolution of recognition functions, and by a shared requirement to maintain the genetic linkage of coadapted gene complexes’. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Polyploidy has rarely been documented in rain forest trees but it has recently been found in African species of the genus Afzelia (Leguminosae), which is composed of four tetraploid rain forest species and two diploid dry forest species. The genus Afzelia thus provides an opportunity to examine how and when polyploidy and habitat shift occurred in Africa, and whether they are associated. In this study, we combined three plastid markers (psbA, trnL, ndhF), two nuclear markers (ribosomal ITS and the single-copy PEPC E7 gene), plastomes (obtained by High Throughput Sequencing) and morphological traits, with an extensive taxonomic and geographic sampling to explore the evolutionary history of Afzelia. Both nuclear DNA and morphological vegetative characters separated diploid from tetraploid lineages. Although the two African diploid species were well differentiated genetically and morphologically, the relationships among the tetraploid species were not resolved. In contrast to the nuclear markers, plastid markers revealed that one of the diploid species forms a well-supported clade with the tetraploids, suggesting historical hybridisation, possibly in relation with genome duplication (polyploidization) and habitat shift from dry to rain forests. Molecular dating based on fossil-anchored gene phylogenies indicates that extant Afzelia started diverging c. 14.5 or 20 Ma while extant tetraploid species started diverging c. 7.0 or 9.4 Ma according to plastid and nuclear DNA, respectively. Additional studies of tropical polyploid plants are needed to assess whether the ploidy-habitat association observed in African Afzelia would reflect a role of polyploidization in niche divergence in the tropics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of main strawberry diseases worldwide. The disease recently arrived in Iran and become epidemic in the Kurdistan province. A combination of morphological, molecular and pathogen-host interaction approaches (referred to the consolidated species concept) were applied to isolates from symptomatic strawberry tissues collected in Iran. Multi-gene phylogenetic analysis based on ITS-rDNA, beta-tubulin (TUB2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) identified the species as the S5 clade of Colletotrichum nymphaeae. No significant intraspecies variation was observed in terms of morphology and pathogenicity. No significant genetic variation was observed among the isolates using inter simple sequence repeat analysis (ISSR) and primer pair combination of ERIC1/BOX and ERIC2/BOX fingerprinting markers. Based on the results of this study, it can be postulated that the C. nymphaeae population in Iran established itself from a single origin due to a founder effect. More generally, molecular dating based on relaxed clocks indicates co-radiation of C. nymphaeae S5 and strawberry plants and suggests high reciprocal specificity between the host and pathogen. © 2016, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.},

abstract={(Table presented.). Summary: Meiosis is fundamental to sexual reproduction and creates genetic variation in progeny. During meiosis paired homologous chromosomes undergo recombination, which can result in reciprocal crossovers. This process can recombine independently arising mutations onto the same chromosome. Recombination locations are highly variable between meioses, although total crossover numbers are tightly regulated. In addition to the effect of meiosis on genetic variation, sequence polymorphisms between homologous chromosomes can feedback onto the recombination pathways. Here we review the major crossover pathways in plants and some of the known homeostatic mechanisms that act during meiotic recombination. We then examine how sequence polymorphisms between homologous chromosomes, that is, heterozygosity, can influence meiotic recombination pathways in cis and trans. Finally, we provide a brief perspective on the relevance of these interconnections for natural selection and adaptation in plants. © 2016 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2016 New Phytologist Trust},

abstract={Confined field trials of genetically modified (GM) trees are the essential step toward the identification of the most productive cultivars and the assessment of the likely environmental impacts of the GM trees including the potential for gene flow by pollen and distance dispersal by seeds. Our study investigated the potential for wildling establishment and realized pollen flow from a clonal GM eucalypt field trial in Southeastern Brazil. The GM eucalypt stand was established in 2009, surrounded by a 3 m wide forest road and signal grass (Bracharia sp.) fields. No seedling regeneration was found between 2010 and 2014 in and around the stand, confirming the expectations of the unlikelihood of eucalypt seedling establishment based on its limited invasive potential in competitive tropical environments. In 2014, open-pollinated seeds were collected from 28 non-GM eucalypts located between three and 650 m distance from the GM trial. A total of 420 seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and screened for the presence of the transgenic construct by a multiplexed PCR assay targeting two transgenes and an internal control. The highest average transgene pollen flow (16%) was seen at short distances (3–15 m), rapidly diminishing to 3% by a 240 m distance and continued at this low rate up to the furthest distance assessed (650 m) from the GM trial. The negative exponential distribution of GM pollination success was similar to that observed in non-GM eucalypt pollen flow studies, indicating that low levels of effective pollination are expected over long distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental assessments of realized pollen flow measured by the effective production of seedlings from a genetically modified tree in field conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are small proteins which bind glutathione to either reduce disulfide bonds or to coordinate iron sulfur clusters. Whereas these well-established functions are associated with ubiquitously occurring GRXs that encode variants of a CPYC or a CGFS motif in the active center, land plants also possess CCxC/S-type GRXs (named ROXYs in Arabidopsis thaliana) for which the biochemical functions are yet unknown. ROXYs and CC-type GRXs from rice and maize physically and genetically interact with bZIP transcription factors of the TGA family to control developmental and stress-associated processes. Here we demonstrate that ROXYs interact with transcriptional co-repressors of the TOPLESS (TPL) family which are related to Tup1 in fungi and Groucho/TLE in animals. In ROXYs, the functionally important conserved A(L/I)W(L/V) motif at the very C terminus mediates the interaction with TPL. A ternary TGA2/ROXY19/TPL complex is formed when all three proteins are co-expressed in yeast. Loss-of-function evidence for the role of TPL in ROXY19-mediated repression was hampered by the redundancy of the five members of the TPL gene family and developmental defects of higher order tpl mutants. As an alternative strategy, we ectopically expressed known TPL-interacting proteins in order to out-compete the amount of available TPL in transiently transformed protoplasts. Indeed, ROXY19-mediated transcriptional repression was strongly alleviated by this approach. Our data suggest a yet unrecognized function of GRXs acting as adapter proteins for the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes on TGA-regulated target promoters. © 2016},

abstract={Although organelle inheritance is predominantly maternal across animals and plants, biparental chloroplast inheritance has arisen multiple times in the angiosperms. Biparental inheritance has the potential to impact the evolutionary dynamics of cytonuclear incompatibility, interactions between nuclear and organelle genomes that are proposed to be among the earliest types of genetic incompatibility to arise in speciation. We examine the interplay between biparental inheritance and cytonuclear incompatibility in Campanulastrum americanum, a plant species exhibiting both traits. We first determine patterns of chloroplast inheritance in genetically similar and divergent crosses, and then associate inheritance with hybrid survival across multiple generations. There is substantial biparental inheritance in C. americanum. The frequency of biparental inheritance is greater in divergent crosses and in the presence of cytonuclear incompatibility. Biparental inheritance helps to mitigate cytonuclear incompatibility, leading to increased fitness of F1 hybrids and recovery in the F2 generation. This study demonstrates the potential for biparental chloroplast inheritance to rescue cytonuclear compatibility, reducing cytonuclear incompatibility's contribution to reproductive isolation and potentially slowing speciation. The efficacy of rescue depended upon the strength of incompatibility, with a greater persistence of weak incompatibilities in later generations. These findings suggest that incompatible plastids may lead to selection for biparental inheritance. © 2016 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2016 New Phytologist Trust},

abstract={Redox regulation of chloroplast enzymes via disulphide reduction is believed to control the rates of CO2 fixation. The study of the thioredoxin reduction pathways and of various target enzymes lead to the following guidelines: i) Thioredoxin gene content is greatly higher in photosynthetic eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes;ii) Thioredoxin-reducing pathways have expanded in photosynthetic eukaryotes with four different thioredoxin reductases and the possibility to reduce some thioredoxins via glutaredoxins;iii) Some enzymes that were thought to be strictly linked to photosynthesis ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, phosphoribulokinase, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase are present in non-photosynthetic organisms;iv) Photosynthetic eukaryotes contain a genetic patchwork of sequences borrowed from prokaryotes including α–proteobacteria and archaea;v) The introduction of redox regulatory sequences did not occur at the same place for all targets. Some possess critical cysteines in cyanobacteria, for others the transition occurred rather at the green algae level;vi) Generally the regulatory sites of the target enzymes are distally located from the catalytic sites. The cysteine residues are generally not involved in catalysis. Following reduction, molecular movements open the active sites and make catalysis possible;vii) The regulatory sequences are located on surface-accessible loops. At least one instance they can be cut out and serve as signal peptides for inducing plant defence. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Urban ecosystems are relatively recent and heavily human-altered terrestrial ecosystems with a surprisingly high diversity of animals, plants and other organisms. Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation.

The exergy analysis of a sea water RO desalination plant was performed and its performance was investigated. A computational model based on the diffusion and convection transport mechanisms as well as the concentration polarization concept, was developed to predict the performance of the RO membrane. Then, the hybrid MED-RO desalination system was studied, the irreversibility analysis was performed and the exergy destruction (considering chemical and physical exergy), exergetic efficiency and system performance were assessed. To obtain the optimum point of the system, the multi-objective optimization with the genetic algorithm tool was used. The determination of the best tradeoff between the exergetic efficiencies of MED and RO, was the final goal of this optimization. The optimum design led to the selection of a MED-RO hybrid system with the highest exergetic efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Apomixis and polyploidy are closely associated in angiosperms, but the evolutionary reason for this association is unknown. Taraxacum officinale, the common dandelion, exists both as diploid sexuals and triploid apomicts. Here, in the context of T. officinale, we provide a model of the evolution of triploid apomicts from diploid sexuals. We posit an apomictic allele that arrests female meiosis in diploids, so that the plant produces diploid egg cells that can develop without fertilization, but haploid pollen. We propose occasional fertilization of diploid egg cells by haploid pollen, resulting in triploid apomicts that produce triploid egg cells but largely nonfunctional pollen. The irreversibility of this process renders diploid partial apomicts evolutionarily short-lived, and results in fixation of triploid apomicts except when they suffer extreme selective disadvantages. Our model can account for the high genetic diversity found in T. officinale triploid populations, because recombinant haploid pollen produced by diploids allows the apomictic allele to spread onto many genetic backgrounds. This leads to multiple clonal lineages in the newly apomictic population, and thereby alleviates some of the usual pitfalls of asexual reproduction.Heredity advance online publication, 11 January 2017; doi:10.1038/hdy.2016.124. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Drought stress is one of the most severe problem limited agricultural productivity worldwide. It has been reported that plants response to drought-stress by sophisticated mechanisms at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the responses of tobacco leaves to drought stress and water status are not well understood. To identify genes and miRNAs involved in drought-stress responses in tobacco, we performed both mRNA and small RNA sequencing on tobacco leaf samples from the following three treatments: untreated-control (CL), drought stress (DL), and re-watering (WL). Results: In total, we identified 798 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the DL and CL (DL vs. CL) treatments and identified 571 DEGs between the WL and DL (WL vs. DL) treatments. Further analysis revealed 443 overlapping DEGs between the DL vs. CL and WL vs. DL comparisons, and, strikingly, all of these genes exhibited opposing expression trends between these two comparisons, strongly suggesting that these overlapping DEGs are somehow involved in the responses of tobacco leaves to drought stress. Functional annotation analysis showed significant up-regulation of genes annotated to be involved in responses to stimulus and stress, (e.g., late embryogenesis abundant proteins and heat-shock proteins) antioxidant defense (e.g., peroxidases and glutathione S-transferases), down regulation of genes related to the cell cycle pathway, and photosynthesis processes. We also found 69 and 56 transcription factors (TFs) among the DEGs in, respectively, the DL vs. CL and the WL vs. DL comparisons. In addition, small RNA sequencing revealed 63 known microRNAs (miRNA) from 32 families and 368 novel miRNA candidates in tobacco. We also found that five known miRNA families (miR398, miR390, miR162, miR166, and miR168) showed differential regulation under drought conditions. Analysis to identify negative correlations between the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and DEGs revealed 92 mRNA-miRNA interactions between CL and DL plants, and 32 mRNA-miRNA interactions between DL and WL plants. Conclusions: This study provides a global view of the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional responses of tobacco under drought stress and re-watering conditions. Our results establish an empirical foundation that should prove valuable for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms through which tobacco, and plants more generally, respond to drought stress at multiple molecular genetic levels. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Glycine betaine functions as an osmotic protectant in response of plant to abiotic stresses. In higher plants, the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) catalyzes the key step of glycine betaine biosynthesis. A lot of effort has been paid to cloning and heterologous expression of the BADH genes from different plants. However, different phenotypes were observed from the transgenic plants. Diversity of subcellular location and functions was found among the members of the BADH family. Our previous report described the cloning of an AnBADH gene from xerophyte Ammopiptanthus nanus and preliminary functional validation in Escherichia coli. In the present study, the function of the AnBADH gene for abiotic tolerance was further characterized by quantitative real time PCR and heterologous expression in Arabidopsis mutant. The results showed that the endogenous expression of the AnBADH gene was strongly induced by the treatments of high salt, dehydration, abscisic acid, heat, and cold. The heterologous expression of the AnBADH gene significantly enhanced tolerance of the Arabidopsis mutant to high salt and drought stresses. Under the stress conditions, the transgenic lines exhibited a more robust root system and a larger fresh weight, higher content of glycine betaine and proline, higher relative water content, lower relative electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content, compared to the untransformed mutant. These results suggest that the AnBADH gene encodes a functional betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, and plays a critical role in the adaptation of A. nanus to its harsh habitat. It provides one more choice for genetic improvement of commercial crops for abiotic tolerance. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract={Yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild, but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban “population” had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations, and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)},

abstract={The fungal genus Trichoderma has been extensively studied due to its role in the mycoparasitism, and thus developed as biocontrol agent against various plant pathogens. Although the mycoparasitic processes of several Trichoderma species have already been well understood, the information about the mycoparasitic mechanisms of Trichoderma strains resulted from different growth conditions or interacting with different phytopathogens is still limited. In this study, we utilized transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 0, 24, 72 and 120 h from T. atroviride strain SS003, growing on an induced-medium with cell walls of Pinus armandii pathogen Cronartium ribicola (CRCW). In total, 86,155,316 reads were obtained with 43,077,658 clean reads. Further, 10,422 genes were identified from four transcriptomes and accounted for 93.89% of annotated genes in T. atroviride IMI 206040 genome, reflecting high-quality sequencing and assembly. In each pairwise comparison, a large number of DEGs were identified with different numbers of genes for up- and down-regulation, respectively. In the presence of CRCW, expression of two main glycoside hydrolase gene families (i.e. chitinase and glucosidase) was induced. Most of 14 secreted enzymes by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis exhibited a consistent expression pattern with that by RNA-Seq data. This comparative study leads to the identification of phase-specific genes in the interactions of T. atroviride SS003 with C. ribicola, and provides potential molecular targets for improved biocontrol strategies. © 2017 The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer-Science and Media},

abstract={The study of allelic variations affecting organogenic capacity is not only relevant for manipulating plant traits but also to understand the fundamental mechanisms involved in plant development. Here, we report the characterization of three tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) loci (RG3C, RG7H and RG8F) whose alleles from its wild relative Solanum pennellii enhance in vitro shoot and root regeneration. S. pennellii alleles were introgressed into tomato cv. Micro-Tom (MT), creating near-isogenic lines. We evaluated the time taken for shoot induction and acquisition of competence by quantifying organogenesis after transferring explants, respectively, from the shoot-inducing medium (SIM) to the basal medium (BM) and from root-inducing medium (RIM) to the SIM. Concomitantly, we monitored the expression of key developmental genes. MT-Rg3C and MT-Rg7H started shoot induction, respectively, at 48 and 24 h earlier than MT and MT-Rg8F, while MT-Rg3C and MT-Rg8F acquired competence 24 h before MT. The impact of MT-Rg3C and MT-Rg8F in the acquisition of competence to assume different fates is consistent with their effect enhancing both shoot and root regeneration. MT-Rg7H seems to affect shoot induction specifically, which is in agreement with the enhanced expression of the shoot-related genes WUSCHEL and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS. Phenotypic characterization of greenhouse-grown plants showed that Rg3C has increased branching when compared to MT. Conversely, the normal branching observed in MT-Rg7H and MT-Rg8F indicates that adventitious in vitro shoot formation and ex vitro axillary bud formation/outgrowth are induced by different genetic pathways. These natural variations are thus useful for breeding highly regenerating varieties without undesirable effects on plant architecture. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract={Deteriorating environments in shallow waters place significant pressure on aquatic plants. To estimate the morphological and genetic diversity of submerged macrophytes at 5 sites characterized by varying degrees of human impact, Myriophyllum spicatum L. was studied. Sediment nitrogen concentrations were found to be significantly correlated with the morphological properties of M. spicatum: the site with high sediment nitrogen concentration had 5 to 10 times larger, but rather uniform (low morphological variability) plants, while the site with the least nitrogen in the sediment had smaller M. spicatum plants that were 4 times more variable than the larger plants. Nevertheless, genetic variability of the studied plants showed no response to nutrient loading in the shallow lakes. The adverse environmental conditions therefore seem not to have affected the genetic material of the sampled plants, thus the large morphological variability observed in association with the nitrogen poor sites was predominantly a result of plastic reactions of M. spicatum to environmental conditions. © 2017 Society of Wetland Scientists},

abstract={This research was conducted to develop genetic transformation of the recalcitrant chrysanthemum cv. Shinma by application of appropriate antibiotics and selective agents. Clavamox had the least inhibitory effect on shoot regeneration compared to timentin, carbenicillin, and cefotaxime. Clavamox, at a concentration of 125 mg L−1, was found to be the most suitable for shoot regeneration and production of quality shoots, suppressing the growth of Agrobacterium in explants infected with strains GV3101 or C58C1 for 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. The concentration of phosphinothricin (PPT) was found to be 1.0 mg L−1 for screening of putative transgenic shoots. Moreover, transgenic chrysanthemums were obtained by culturing explants co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring an anthocyanin regulatory gene RsMYB1 isolated from radish (Raphanus sativus), which was placed under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV) 35S and petal-specific promoter InMYB1 isolated from the morning glory (Ipomoea nil), on shoot regeneration medium supplemented with recommended concentration of antibiotic and selective agent. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that there was no variation in ploidy level between transgenic plants and donor plants (non-transformants). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of Clavamox and MYB transcription factor for genetic transformation of this chrysanthemum. © 2016 Societa Botanica Italiana.},

abstract={Taxol is amongst the most effective anti-cancer drugs available in market. The increasing demand of this compound due to its use in treating wide range of cancers, as well as its high cost have triggered efforts to find alternative ways to obtain this drug. Hazel (Corylus avellana), which is already cultivated for nutritional aspects, is now attracting attention for its phytochemical content. Notably the discovery of taxol and related taxanes in this plant species prompted extensive interest to explore biotechnological production of these compounds using in vitro cultures of C. avellana. This review emphasizes the potential of C. avellana cells for production of taxol and related taxanes. The botanical description of C. avellana, its pharmacological uses and various biotechnological approaches, such as micropropagation, cell culture and genetic engineering to increase the production of taxol and related taxanes are discussed. To present an overall overview, the experience of researchers working on these aspects is mentioned and major highlights or discoveries are presented. A review of the literature suggests that C. avellana may act as a commercial and alternative source for taxol production in an eco-friendly way, which will meet the ever-increasing demand, and also help reducing the cost of this anti-cancer compound. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract={Plants have undergone 470 million years of evolution on land and different groups have distinct body shapes. Liverworts are the most ancient land plant lineage and have a flattened, creeping body (the thallus), which grows from apical cells in an invaginated “notch.” The genetic mechanisms regulating liverwort shape are almost totally unknown, yet they provide a blueprint for the radiation of land plant forms. We have used a combination of live imaging, growth analyses, and computational modeling to determine what regulates liverwort thallus shape in Marchantia polymorpha. We find that the thallus undergoes a stereotypical sequence of shape transitions during the first 2 weeks of growth and that key aspects of global shape depend on regional growth rate differences generated by the coordinated activities of the apical notches. A “notch-drives-growth” model, in which a diffusible morphogen produced at each notch promotes specified isotropic growth, can reproduce the growth rate distributions that generate thallus shape given growth suppression at the apex. However, in surgical experiments, tissue growth persists following notch excision, showing that this model is insufficient to explain thallus growth. In an alternative “notch-pre-patterns-growth” model, a persistently acting growth regulator whose distribution is pre-patterned by the notches can account for the discrepancies between growth dynamics in the notch-drives-growth model and real plants following excision. Our work shows that growth rate heterogeneity is the primary shape determinant in Marchantia polymorpha and suggests that the thallus is likely to have zones with specialized functions. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Currently, many Brazilian orchids are threatened with extinction resulting from habitat loss and intense harvesting pressure stemming from their value as ornamental plants. Therefore, the genetic diversity in remaining populations is fundamental to the survival of these species in natural environments. In order to inform conservation strategies, this study evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of Cattleya granulosa populations. The sample consisted of 151 individuals from 12 populations in the Atlantic Forest, northeastern Brazil, evaluated using 91 ISSR markers. Genetic variability was assessed through molecular variance, diversity indexes, clusters of genotypes through Bayesian analysis, and tests for genetic bottlenecks. From all polymorphic loci, genetic diversity (HE) varied between 0.210 and 0.321 and the Shannon index ranged from 0.323 and 0.472. Significant genetic differentiation between populations (ΦST = 0.391; P &lt; 0.0001) resulted in the division of the populations into five groups based on the log-likelihood Bayesian analysis. We found significant positive correlation between geographical and genetic distances between populations (r = 0.794; P = 0.017), indicating isolation by distance. Patterns of allelic diversity within populations suggest the occurrence of bottlenecks in most C. granulosa populations (n = 8). Therefore, in order to maintain the genetic diversity of the species, the conservation of spatially distant groups is necessary. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract={Key message: New software to make tetraploid genotype calls from SNP array data was developed, which uses hierarchical clustering and multiple F1 populations to calibrate the relationship between signal intensity and allele dosage. Abstract: SNP arrays are transforming breeding and genetics research for autotetraploids. To fully utilize these arrays, the relationship between signal intensity and allele dosage must be calibrated for each marker. We developed an improved computational method to automate this process, which is provided as the R package ClusterCall. In the training phase of the algorithm, hierarchical clustering within an F1 population is used to group samples with similar intensity values, and allele dosages are assigned to clusters based on expected segregation ratios. In the prediction phase, multiple F1 populations and the prediction set are clustered together, and the genotype for each cluster is the mode of the training set samples. A concordance metric, defined as the proportion of training set samples equal to the mode, can be used to eliminate unreliable markers and compare different algorithms. Across three potato families genotyped with an 8K SNP array, ClusterCall scored 5729 markers with at least 0.95 concordance (94.6% of its total), compared to 5325 with the software fitTetra (82.5% of its total). The three families were used to predict genotypes for 5218 SNPs in the SolCAP diversity panel, compared with 3521 SNPs in a previous study in which genotypes were called manually.

abstract={Background: Sunflower Verticillium wilt (SVW) is a vascular disease caused by root infection with Verticillium dahliae (V. dahlia). It is a serious threat to the yield and quality of sunflower. However, chemical and agronomic measures for controlling this disease are not effective. The selection of more resistant genotypes is a desirable strategy to reduce contamination. A deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis underlying sunflower Verticillium wilt is necessary to accelerate breeding progress. Results: An RNA-Seq approach was used to perform global transcriptome profiling on the roots of resistant (S18) and susceptible (P77) sunflower genotypes infected with V. dahlia. Different pairwise transcriptome comparisons were examined over a time course (6, 12 and 24 h, and 2, 3, 5 and 10 d post inoculation). In RD, SD and D datasets, 1231 genes were associated with SVW resistance in a genotype-common transcriptional pattern. Moreover, 759 and 511 genes were directly related to SVW resistance in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively, in a genotype-specific transcriptional pattern. Most of the genes were demonstrated to participate in plant defense responses; these genes included peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase, aquaporin PIP, chitinase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and LRR receptors. For the up-regulated genotype-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the resistant genotype, higher average fold-changes were observed in the resistant genotype compared to those in the susceptible genotype. An inverse effect was observed in the down-regulated genotype-specific DEGs in the resistant genotype. KEGG analyses showed that 98, 112 and 52 genes were classified into plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction and flavonoid biosynthesis categories, respectively. Many of these genes, such as CNGC, RBOH, FLS2, JAZ, MYC2 NPR1 and TGA, regulate crucial points in defense-related pathway and may contribute to V. dahliae resistance in sunflower. Conclusions: The transcriptome profiling results provided a clearer understanding of the transcripts associated with the crosstalk between sunflower and V. dahliae. The results identified several differentially expressed unigenes involved in the hyper sensitive response (HR) and the salicylic acid (SA)/jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated signal transduction pathway for resistance against V. dahliae. These results are useful for screening resistant sunflower genotypes. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Cyanobacteria are industrially robust photosynthetic microorganisms that can be genetically programmed to synthesize commodity products for domestic and industrial consumption. In the present work, Synechocystis was endowed with the synthesis of the plant secondary metabolite geranyllinalool, a diterpene alcohol of commercial interest. Total average yields of 360 μg of geranyllinalool per gram of dry cell weight were obtained in the course of a 48-h cultivation period. Geranyllinalool was primarily sequestered inside the transformant cells, corresponding to 60–70% of the total heterologous product, instead of being entirely exuded, as the case is with shorter heterologous terpene hydrocarbons. Extraction of geranyllinalool necessitated disruption of the cells in order to release and isolate this chemical product. Moreover, geranyllinalool accumulation in the cells caused a mild inhibitory effect on cell fitness and biomass growth rate, such that the duplication time of Synechocystis transformants was 1.4-fold longer than that of the control. The remaining 30–40% of the geranyllinalool product was found to float on the surface of sealed transformant cultures, where it was siphoned off by applying a hydrophobic overlayer, with no need to disrupt the cells in this case. Concluding, the work extended efforts to heterologously produce terpene and terpenol products in cyanobacteria, and addressed possibilities and constrains inherent to this production system. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract={One of the important antiviral genetic strategies used in crop breeding is recessive resistance. Two eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family genes, eIF4E and eIFiso4E, are the most common recessive resistance genes whose absence inhibits infection by plant viruses in Potyviridae, Carmovirus, and Cucumovirus. Here, we show that another eIF4E family gene, nCBP, acts as a novel recessive resistance gene in Arabidopsis thaliana toward plant viruses in Alpha- and Betaflexiviridae. We found that infection by Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV), a potexvirus, was delayed in ncbp mutants of A. thaliana. Virus replication efficiency did not differ between an ncbp mutant and a wild type plant in single cells, but viral cell-to-cell movement was significantly delayed in the ncbp mutant. Furthermore, the accumulation of triple-gene-block protein 2 (TGB2) and TGB3, the movement proteins of potexviruses, decreased in the ncbp mutant. Inoculation experiments with several viruses showed that the accumulation of viruses encoding TGBs in their genomes decreased in the ncbp mutant. These results indicate that nCBP is a novel member of the eIF4E family recessive resistance genes whose loss impairs viral cell-to-cell movement by inhibiting the efficient accumulation of TGB2 and TGB3. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Sex ratio variation is commonly observed in natural populations of many organisms with separate sexes and genetic sex determination, including bryophytes. Most bryophyte populations exhibit female-skewed expressed adult sex ratios, generally inferred from counts of sexually mature plants. For the rarely sexually reproducing perennial dioicous moss Drepanocladus lycopodioides, we showed that a female bias also exists in the genetic adult sex ratio, using a specifically designed molecular sex-associated marker. Here, we investigated whether the meiotic spore sex ratio contributes to the observed bias in genetic adult sex ratio in natural populations. Earlier attempts to study meiotic sex ratios have involved commonly cultivated ruderals that rapidly express sex in the laboratory. We established single-spore cultures from field-collected sporophytes from these populations and used the marker to assess the sex of individual sporelings. Spore germinability was (near) complete, and mortality among sporelings was virtually absent. The true meiotic sex ratio did not differ from equality, but strongly differed both from the observed genetic sex ratios in the natural adult populations, and from the European scale genetic sex ratio. We conclude that the biased population sex ratios in this species arise at life cycle stages after spore germination. Sexual dimorphism may selectively favour female proliferation during some phase of gametophyte development. Based on methodological progress, we successfully used a perennial study species with rare sexual reproduction, which significantly broadens the life history spectrum investigated in bryophyte sex ratio studies. © British Bryological Society 2017},

abstract={Pollen ornamentation patterns are important in the study of plant genetic evolution and systematic taxonomy. However, they are normally difficult to quantify. Based on observations of pollen exine ornamentation characteristics of 128 flowering crabapple germplasms (44 natural species and 84 varieties), three qualitative variables with binary properties (Xi: regularity of pollen exine ornamentation; Yi: scope of ornamentation arrangement regularity; Zi: ornamentation arrangement patterns) were extracted to establish a binary three-dimensional data matrix (Xi Yi Zi) and the matrix data were converted to decimal data through weight assignment, which facilitated the unification of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. The result indicates that from species population to variety population and from parent population to variety population, the exine ornamentation of all three dimensions present the evolutionary trend of regular → irregular, wholly regular → partially regular, and single pattern → multiple patterns. Regarding the evolutionary degree, the regularity of ornamentation was significantly lower in both the variety population and progeny population, with a degree of decrease 0.82-1.27 times that of the regularity range of R-type ornamentation. In addition, the evolutionary degree significantly increased along Xi Yi → Zi. The result also has certain reference values for defining the taxonomic status of Malus species. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) is a critical enzyme involved in photosynthetic carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Here, we report the effects of SBPase overexpression on the tolerance to chilling-induced oxidative stress in transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. In transgenic plants overexpressing SBPase, CO2 fixation and carbohydrate accumulation were increased in comparison with equivalent wild-type plants. SBPase was found to be susceptible to oxidative stress and the activity was substantially inhibited by reactive oxygen species both in vivo and in vitro. In response to chilling stress, production of H2O2 was increased in parallel with the reduction in SBPase activity in tomato plants, however, transgenic plants maintained significantly higher SBPase activity than wild-type plants did. Under chilling stress, compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants were found to have increased CO2 fixation and reduced electrolyte leakage. The overall tolerance could be ascribed to the enhancement of photosynthetic carbon fixation, the reductions in the level of H2O2 and the increased accumulation of carbohydrate in transgenic plants. Collectively, our data suggest that high level of SBPase activity gives an advantage to photosynthetic carbon fixation and tolerance to chilling-induced oxidative stress in tomato plants. This work presents a case study that an individual enzyme in the Calvin cycle may be a useful target for genetically engineering stress tolerance in horticultural crops. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Polyploidy is well studied from a genetic and genomic perspective, but the morphological, anatomical, and physiological consequences of polyploidy remain relatively uncharacterized. Whether these potential changes bear on functional integration or are idiosyncratic remains an open question. Repeated allotetraploid events and multiple genomic combinations as well as overlapping targets of artificial selection make the Brassica triangle an excellent system for exploring variation in the connection between plant structure (anatomy and morphology) and function (physiology). We examine phenotypic integration among structural aspects of leaves including external morphology and internal anatomy with leaf-level physiology among several species of Brassica. We compare diploid and allotetraploid species to ascertain patterns of phenotypic correlations among structural and functional traits and test the hypothesis that allotetraploidy results in trait disintegration allowing for transgressive phenotypes and additional evolutionary and crop improvement potential. Results: Among six Brassica species, we found significant effects of species and ploidy level for morphological, anatomical and physiological traits. We identified three suites of intercorrelated traits in both diploid parents and allotetraploids: Morphological traits (such as leaf area and perimeter) anatomic traits (including ab- and ad- axial epidermis) and aspects of physiology. In general, there were more correlations between structural and functional traits for allotetraploid hybrids than diploid parents. Parents and hybrids did not have any significant structure-function correlations in common. Of particular note, there were no significant correlations between morphological structure and physiological function in the diploid parents. Increased phenotypic integration in the allotetraploid hybrids may be due, in part, to increased trait ranges or simply different structure-function relationships. Conclusions: Genomic and chromosomal instability in early generation allotetraploids may allow Brassica species to explore new trait space and potentially reach higher adaptive peaks than their progenitor species could, despite temporary fitness costs associated with unstable genomes. The trait correlations that disappear after hybridization as well as the novel trait correlations observed in allotetraploid hybrids may represent relatively evolutionarily labile associations and therefore could be ideal targets for artificial selection and crop improvement. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Genetic analysis reveals that DELLAs play an essential role in growth reduction mediated by CBF1, -2, -3 genes. The in vivo and in vitro evidences demonstrate that GA2-oxidase 7 gene is a novel CBF3 regulon. Meanwhile, DELLAs contribute to cold induction of CBF1, -2, -3 genes through interaction with jasmonate (JA) signaling. We conclude that CBF3 promotes DELLAs accumulation through repressing GA biosynthesis and DELLAs positively regulate CBF3 involving JA signaling.

abstract={Plants have the ability to respond to seasonal environmental variations by monitoring day length to initiate flowering. The transition from vegetative to the reproductive stage is the critical developmental switch in flowering plants to ensure optimal fitness and/or yield. It has been previously reported that B-BOX32 (BBX32) has the potential to increase grain yield when ectopically expressed in soybean. In the present study, we performed a detailed molecular characterization of the Arabidopsis B-box domain gene BBX32. We showed that the circadian clock in Arabidopsis regulates BBX32 and expressed in the early morning. To understand the molecular mechanism of BBX32 regulation, we performed a large-scale yeast twohybrid screen and identified CONSTANS-LIKE 3 (COL3)/BBX4 as one of its interacting protein partners. Using different genetic and biochemical assays, we have validated this interaction and shown that COL3 targets FT in the presence of BBX32 to regulate the flowering pathway. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that this BBX32-COL3 module could be an additional regulatory mechanism affecting the reproductive development in Arabidopsis that could be translated to crops for increased agricultural productivity.},

abstract={Background: Ashbya gossypii is a filamentous fungus that is currently exploited for the industrial production of riboflavin. The utilization of A. gossypii as a microbial biocatalyst is further supported by its ability to grow in low-cost feedstocks, inexpensive downstream processing and the availability of an ease to use molecular toolbox for genetic and genomic modifications. Consequently, A. gossypii has been also introduced as an ideal biotechnological chassis for the production of inosine, folic acid, and microbial oils. However, A. gossypii cannot use xylose, the most common pentose in hydrolysates of plant biomass. Results: In this work, we aimed at designing A. gossypii strains able to utilize xylose as the carbon source for the production of biolipids. An endogenous xylose utilization pathway was identified and overexpressed, resulting in an A. gossypii xylose-metabolizing strain showing prominent conversion rates of xylose to xylitol (up to 97% after 48 h). In addition, metabolic flux channeling from xylulose-5-phosphate to acetyl-CoA, using aheterologous phosphoketolase pathway, increased the lipid content in the xylose-metabolizing strain a 54% over the parental strain growing in glucose-based media. This increase raised to 69% when lipid accumulation was further boosted by blocking the beta-oxidation pathway. Conclusions: Ashbya gossypii has been engineered for the utilization of xylose. We present here a proof-of-concept study for the production of microbial oils from xylose in A. gossypii, thus introducing a novel biocatalyst with very promising properties in developing consolidated bioprocessing to produce fine chemicals and biofuels from xylose-rich hydrolysates of plant biomass. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We explored the possibility of generating nonpoisonous, renewable, low cost and a completely biodegradable photosensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) as an alternative to synthetic molecules that involve expensive, time-consuming tedious synthesis and purification procedures. Several natural dyes from plants and microbes had successfully been demonstrated as photosensitizers to develop biosensitized solar cells (BSSCs). The objective of this work is to develop a next generation cleaner sensitizer for BSSC using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its designer variant (GFPdopa) through an expanding genetic code approach. The designer protein showed higher adsorption with TiO2 surface through oriented immobilization. The nanostructured layer formed by GFPdopa with TiO2 resulted in 0.94% level of photon conversion efficiency with open circuit voltage of 0.60 V, short circuit current of 1.75 mA/cm2 and fill factor of 0.88. It is one of the better energy conversion efficiencies obtained for BSSC when compared to with earlier reported sensitizers generated through protein and chemical complex synergism. From the results obtained, it is suggested that designer fluorescent itself can generate similar photoconversion efficiency and also could serve as an environmental friendly photosensitizer. The research and efficiency level of BSSC is in the early stages, and our proof of principle opens a new avenue to synthesize biologically designer sensitizers for BSSC. It also could be widely applied to other proteins to develop efficient sensitizers for BSSC with a green approach. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Genetic homogeneity is known to be the most important prerequisite in the micropropagation of Jatropha curcas L. to produce true-to-type plants. The detection of genetic homogeneity in clonal micropropagation for elite plants at an early stage is required, to avoid any increase in variation in the next stage of micropropagation. The genetic homogeneity was assessed during shoot bud formation from petiole explants of J.curcas (P1 × P3) hybrid with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ) in a range of 0.5–4.0 mg/L using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 23 ISSR primers, 16 primers produced clear, distinct and reproducible bands. A total of 96 bands, ranging in size from 100 to 1013 bp were generated. Based on the band data, a total of 94 bands were monomorphic (98%) and two bands were polymorphic (2%). All banding patterns from the shoot buds induced by 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L TDZ were monomorphic, but 4.0 mg/L gave 2% polymorphism. These findings indicated that concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L TDZ did not trigger any somaclonal variation and could, therefore, be considered suitable for application in clonal micropropagation of J. curcas hybrid using petioles as explant material. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Ramie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud) is one of the most important natural fibre crops. For enhanced crop development, it is necessary to understand its population structure and genetic relationships. In this study, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of 134 ramie accessions (with three plants per accession) from 12 regions by using 36 simple sequence repeat markers. The 36 microsatellite primers revealed 149 alleles in 134 ramie populations, with an average of 4.14 alleles per locus. The structure analysis divided the 134 ramie accessions into three groups (I, II and III), and into further six subgroups (a, b, c, d, e and f). In Subgroup b, 13 accessions were from Guizhou Province, 9 accessions were from Sichuan Province and the remaining 20 accessions were from Chongqing (4), Hunan (8), Guangxi (4), Jiangxi (2), Yunan (1) and Taiwan (1). In Subgroup d, 22 accessions were from Guizhou Province and the remaining 17 accessions were from Chongqing (6), Sichuan (5) and Yunnan (6). It can be inferred that the genetic background of these ramie accessions did not always correlate with their geographical regions. Similar results were found in Subgroups a and f. The pair-wise genetic similarity coefficients between the 134 accessions ranged from 0.390 to 0.939, which suggested that there was abundant genetic diversity in the ramie accessions. These markers have provided important information about the genetic structure of ramie, which can contribute to future breeding and improvement programmes for these resources. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Aim: To investigate the relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters in Australian plant species and to determine the associations in relation to predictions from population theory and previous global analyses. Location: Continent of Australia. Methods: We assembled a dataset of all known population genetic analyses of Australian plants based on neutral markers and catalogued them according to key species attributes, including range, abundance, range disjunction, biome and growth form; and genetic parameters, mean number of alleles per locus, observed and expected heterozygosity and population differentiation. We determined relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters using a maximum-likelihood, multimodel inference approach. Results: We found many associations that were consistent with predictions. Species attributes with greatest effect on genetic diversity were range size, growth form, abundance and biome. The most important attributes influencing genetic differentiation were range disjunction and abundance. We found unexpected results in the effects of biome and growth form on genetic diversity, with greater diversity in the eastern biome of Australia, and lower diversity in shrubs compared to trees. Main conclusions: Our analysis of genetic diversity of Australian plants showed associations consistent with predictions based on population genetics theory, with strong effects of range size, abundance and growth form. We identified a striking effect of range disjunction on population genetic differentiation, an effect that has received little attention in the literature. We also found some notable differences to global predictions, which were most likely explained by confounding effects across variables. This highlights that caution is needed when extrapolating trends from global analyses to regional floras. Identifying associations between species attributes and patterns of genetic diversity enables broadscale predictions to facilitate the inclusion of genetic considerations into conservation decision-making. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={An efficient in vitro plant regeneration system was established via somatic embryogenesis of Hypoxis hemerocallidea, an extensively utilized medicinal plant in South African traditional medicine. Embryogenic callus was obtained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 15 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2.5 μM N6-benzyladenine (BA). Different developmental stages of somatic embryos (SEs: globular embryos, torpedo-shaped embryos and cotyledonary embryos) were obtained and further matured from the embryogenic callus by subsequent subculture on the same medium. Highest frequency of somatic embryos (30.56 ± 1.15) was recovered after 6 weeks. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of somatic embryos. Mature somatic embryos germinated and developed into plantlets after 4 weeks on half strength MS basal agar medium. The germination frequency reached 88.9% when using half strength MS basal agar medium supplemented with 1.44 μM gibberellic acid (GA3). Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the greenhouse with a survival rate of 90%. This is the first report on the establishment of H. hemerocallidea somatic embryogenesis.

abstract={Bromus auleticus Trinius (ex Nees) is a perennial allogamous C3 grass native to the Campos grasslands. It has potential to play a key role in restoration of both abandoned agricultural and overgrazed lands. We aim to reveal the existence of local adaptation and to assess whether phenotypes could be differentiated in relation to their ecogeographic region of origin. Previous reports estimated significant levels of variability among and within populations, but as yet there is no evidence of local adaptation and phenotypic relations with ecogeographic regions for this species. Indeed, there is a lack of knowledge about the spatial distribution of diversity, which limits the possibilities of using B. auleticus in ecological restoration and plant breeding. A comprehensive collection of 82 accessions of B. auleticus from eight ecogeographic regions within Uruguay was used to characterize diversity by measuring phenologic, morphologic, productive and reproductive traits. We found high diversity among B. auleticus accessions, and the spatial distribution of this diversity follows a pattern accounted by ecogeographic regions to a large extent. Our results also indicate large genotype × environment interaction, confirming local adaptation. Phenotypic values permitted, with a 3.7% error rate, discrimination of accessions according to their ecogeographic region of origin, suggesting the existence of differentiated ecotypes. We consider that the diversity observed should be conserved and used for breeding cultivars of this species and for the restoration of degraded grasslands by considering ecogeographic regions when selecting seed sources. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Key message: Using map-based cloning, we delimited theMs-cd1gene responsible for the male sterile phenotype inB. oleraceato an approximately 39-kb fragment. Expression analysis suggests that a new predicted gene, a homolog of theArabidopsis SIED1gene, is a potential candidate gene. Abstract: A dominant genic male sterile (DGMS) mutant 79-399-3 in Brassica oleracea (B. oleracea) is controlled by a single gene named Ms-cd1, which was genetically mapped on chromosome C09. The derived DGMS lines of 79-399-3 have been successfully applied in hybrid cabbage breeding and commercial hybrid seed production of several B. oleracea cultivars in China. However, the Ms-cd1 gene responsible for the DGMS has not been identified, and the molecular basis of the DGMS is unclear, which then limits its widespread application in hybrid cabbage seed production. In the present study, a large BC9 population with 12,269 individuals was developed for map-based cloning of the Ms-cd1 gene, and Ms-cd1 was mapped to a 39.4-kb DNA fragment between two InDel markers, InDel14 and InDel24. Four genes were identified in this region, including two annotated genes based on the available B. oleracea annotation database and two new predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Finally, a newly predicted ORF designated Bol357N3 was identified as the candidate of the Ms-cd1 gene. These results will be useful to reveal the molecular mechanism of the DGMS and develop more practical DGMS lines with stable male sterility for hybrid seed production in cabbage. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Metal hyperaccumulation is an uncommon but highly distinctive adaptation found in certain plants that can grow on metalliferous soils. Here we review what is known about evolution of metal hyperaccumulation in plants and describe a population-genetic analysis of the Alyssum serpyllifolium (Brassicaceae) species complex that includes populations of nickel-hyperaccumulating as well as non-accumulating plants growing on serpentine (S) and non-serpentine (NS) soils, respectively. To test whether the S and NS populations belong to the same or separate closely related species, we analysed genetic variation within and between four S and four NS populations from across the Iberian peninsula. Based on microsatellites, genetic variation was similar in S and NS populations (average H o =0.48). The populations were significantly differentiated from each other (overall F ST =0.23), and the degree of differentiation between S and NS populations was similar to that within these two groups. However, high S versus NS differentiation was observed in DNA polymorphism of two genes putatively involved in adaptation to serpentine environments, IREG1 and NRAMP4, whereas no such differentiation was found in a gene (ASIL1) not expected to play a specific role in ecological adaptation in A. serpyllifolium. These results indicate that S and NS populations belong to the same species and that nickel hyperaccumulation in A. serpyllifolium appears to represent a case of adaptation to growth on serpentine soils. Further functional and evolutionary genetic work in this system has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the evolution of metal hyperaccumulation in plants. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1), VRN2, and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of VRN1 and FT are conserved in Brachypodium distachyon yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of VRN2. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference B. distachyon accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the B. distachyon homologs of the major flowering pathway genes VRN2 and FT, whereas no linkage was observed at VRN1. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in B. distachyon provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={The invasion of the land by plants, or terrestrialization, was one of the most critical events in the history of the Earth. The evolution of land plants included significant transformations in body plans: the emergence of a multicellular diploid sporophyte, transition from gametophyte-dominant to sporophyte-dominant life histories, and development of many specialized tissues and organs, such as stomata, vascular tissues, roots, leaves, seeds, and flowers. Recent advances in molecular genetics in two model basal plants, bryophytes Physcomitrella patens and Marchantia polymorpha, have begun to provide answers to several key questions regarding land plant evolution.

abstract={To understand the molecular mechanisms of rice aerial organ development, we identified a mutant gene that caused a significant decrease in the width of aerial organs, termed ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES (AVB). Histological analysis showed that the slender aerial organs were caused by cell number reduction. In avb, the number of vascular bundles in aerial organs was reduced, whereas the area of the vascular bundles was increased. Ploidy analysis and the in situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in avb. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in avb. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that AVB encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions. Our research shows that AVB is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the AVB gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Discovering local adaptation, its genetic underpinnings, and environmental drivers is important for conserving forest species. Ecological genomic approaches coupled with next-generation sequencing are useful means to detect local adaptation and uncover its underlying genetic basis in nonmodel species. We report results from a study on flowering dogwood trees (Cornus florida L.) using genotyping by sequencing (GBS). This species is ecologically important to eastern US forests but is severely threatened by fungal diseases. We analyzed subpopulations in divergent ecological habitats within North Carolina to uncover loci under local selection and associated with environmental–functional traits or disease infection. At this scale, we tested the effect of incorporating additional sequencing before scaling for a broader examination of the entire range. To test for biases of GBS, we sequenced two similarly sampled libraries independently from six populations of three ecological habitats. We obtained environmental–functional traits for each subpopulation to identify associations with genotypes via latent factor mixed modeling (LFMM) and gradient forests analysis. To test whether heterogeneity of abiotic pressures resulted in genetic differentiation indicative of local adaptation, we evaluated Fst per locus while accounting for genetic differentiation between coastal subpopulations and Piedmont-Mountain subpopulations. Of the 54 candidate loci with sufficient evidence of being under selection among both libraries, 28–39 were Arlequin–BayeScan Fst outliers. For LFMM, 45 candidates were associated with climate (of 54), 30 were associated with soil properties, and four were associated with plant health. Reanalysis of combined libraries showed that 42 candidate loci still showed evidence of being under selection. We conclude environment-driven selection on specific loci has resulted in local adaptation in response to potassium deficiencies, temperature, precipitation, and (to a marginal extent) disease. High allele turnover along ecological gradients further supports the adaptive significance of loci speculated to be under selection. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant gene silencing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant genes are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant gene (35S-LUC, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease OTS1 gene is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter 35S-LUC and an endogenous mutator-like element MULE-F19G14 at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in ots1 mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream genes. In addition to ots1 mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, SIZ1 and MMS21, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The objective of this work was to evaluate seven wild passion fruit (P. cincinnata) accessions, using morphological and agronomic descriptors and molecular markers type ISSR, to identify their morphoagronomic and genetic variabilities and potential for use in breeding programs. A randomized block experimental design was used with five replications and two plants per plot. Thirteen qualitative and twenty-one quantitative, vegetative and floral characteristics were used for morphoagronomic characterization. Twelve ISSR primers were evaluated for molecular characterization. Among the qualitative characteristics, only the color variations were significantly different between the accessions. According to the mean squares of the quantitative characteristics evaluated, obtained from analysis of variance, the means of accessions showed significant differences (p<0.01) for all characteristics. The IAL (internode average length) was the morphological descriptor that most contributed to diversity, with 43.12%, followed by DH5 (stem diameter at 5 cm height) and SW (sepal width). The average genetic similarity found was 68%. Despite the low genetic variability found among accessions, the primers UBC-887 and UBC-841 stood out with high percentage of polymorphism with 14 and 11 polymorphic fragments, respectively, and higher values of polymorphism information content (PIC), resolving power (RP) and marker index (MI), denoting suitability for use in diversity studies of P. cincinnata.

abstract={De novo assembly of reads produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offers a rapid approach to obtain expressed gene sequences for non-model organisms. Senna (Cassia angustifolia Vahl.) is a drought-tolerant annual undershrub of Caesalpiniaceae, a subfamily of Fabaceae. There are insufficient transcriptomic and genomic data in public databases for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the drought tolerance of senna. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to know the transcriptome profile of senna, with special reference to drought stress. RNA from two different stages of leaf development was extracted and sequenced separately using the Illumina technology. A total of 200 million reads were generated, and a de novo assembly of processed reads in the pooled transcriptome using Trinity yielded 43,413 transcripts which were further annotated using NCBI BLAST with “green plant database (txid 33090),” Swiss Prot, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Gene Ontology (GO). Out of the total transcripts, 42,280 (95.0 %) were annotated by BLASTX against the green plant database of NCBI. Senna transcriptome showed the highest similarity to Glycine max (41 %), followed by Phaseolus vulgaris (16 %), Cicer arietinum (15 %), and Medicago trancatula (5 %). The highest number of GO terms were enriched for the molecular functions category; of these “catalytic activity” (GO: 0003824) (25.10 %) and “binding activity” (GO: 0005488) (20.10 %) were most abundantly represented. We used InterProscan to see protein similarity at domain level; a total of 33,256 transcripts were annotated against the Pfam domains. The transcripts were assigned with various KEGG pathways. Coding DNA sequences (CDS) encoding various drought stress-regulated pathways such as signaling factors, protein-modifying/degrading enzymes, biosynthesis of phytohormone, phytohormone signaling, osmotically active compounds, free radical scavengers, chlorophyll metabolism, leaf cuticular wax, polyamines, and protective proteins were identified through BLASTX search. The lucine-rich repeat kinase family was the most abundantly found group of protein kinases. Orphan, bHLH, and bZIP family TFs were the most abundantly found in senna. Six genes encoding MYC2 transcription factor, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), l-ascorbate peroxidase (APX), aminocyclopropane carboxylate oxidase (ACO), abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase (ABA), and WRKY transcription factor were confirmed through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing for the first time in senna. The potential drought stress-related transcripts identified in this study provide a good start for further investigation into the drought adaptation in senna. Additionally, our transcriptome sequences are the valuable resource for accelerated genomics-assisted genetic improvement programs and facilitate manipulation of biochemical pathways for developing drought-tolerant genotypes of crop plants. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Here, we identified four genes encoding ripening-regulated DREB TFs in banana (Musa acuminata), MaDREB1, MaDREB2, MaDREB3, and MaDREB4, and demonstrated that they play regulatory roles in fruit ripening. We showed that MaDREB1-MaDREB4 are nucleus-localized, induced by ethylene and encompass transcriptional activation activities. We performed a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiment for MaDREB2 and identified 697 genomic regions as potential targets of MaDREB2. MaDREB2 binds to hundreds of loci with diverse functions and its binding sites are distributed in the promoter regions proximal to the transcriptional start site (TSS). Most of the MaDREB2-binding targets contain the conserved (A/G)CC(G/C)AC motif and MaDREB2 appears to directly regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in fruit ripening. In combination with transcriptome profiling (RNA sequencing) data, our results indicate that MaDREB2 may serve as both transcriptional activator and repressor during banana fruit ripening. In conclusion, our study suggests a hierarchical regulatory model of fruit ripening in banana and that the MaDREB TFs may act as transcriptional regulators in the regulatory network. © 2017 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={Efficient and genotype-independent in vitro regeneration is an essential prerequisite for incremental trait improvement in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) via genetic transformation. We have optimized a facile and rapid method to obtain direct shoot organogenesis from cotyledonary node (CN) explants excised from peanut seedlings germinated on cytokinin-supplemented Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium. Starting with mature embryos, shoot induction occurred in approximately 7 weeks, followed by 4 weeks for rooting of excised shoots and 3 weeks of acclimatization of regenerated plantlets in soil. The regeneration and transformation system described here is time-efficient, yielding greenhouse-acclimatized plantlets within 14 weeks, in contrast to 12–14 months required for initiating and regenerating somatic embryogenic cultures, currently the most tractable method available for peanut transformation. The highest shoot induction frequency and shoot quality was obtained with 6.66 μM 6-benzylaminopurine, followed by adequate root induction at 5.37 μM α-Naphthaleneacetic acid. New Mexican Valencia A was chosen for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Stable GUS expression from pWBvec10a was obtained at a transformation rate of 1.25 %. Furthermore, results from genomic PCR and Southern blot analyses showed that 14 out of 576 putative transgenic regenerants contained transgene pSag12::IPT, therefore yielding a total transformation rate of 2.43 %. The cotyledonary node-based direct regeneration system described here is time-efficient and amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and therefore should be further explored for peanut transgenic improvement. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Solid tumors are multiscale, open, complex, dynamic systems: complex because they have many interacting components, dynamic because both the components and their interactions can change with time, and open because the tumor freely communicates with surrounding and even distant host tissue. Thus, it is not surprising that striking intratumoral variations are commonly observed in clinical imaging such as MRI and CT and that several recent studies found striking regional variations in the molecular properties of cancer cells from the same tumor. Interestingly, this spatial heterogeneity in molecular properties of tumor cells is typically ascribed to branching clonal evolution due to accumulating mutations while macroscopic variations observed in, for example, clinical MRI scans are usually viewed as functions of blood flow. The clinical significance of spatial heterogeneity has not been fully determined but there is a general consensus that the varying intratumoral landscape along with patient factors such as age, morbidity and lifestyle, contributes significantly to the often unpredictable response of individual patients within a disease cohort treated with the same standard-of-care therapy. Here we investigate the potential link between macroscopic tumor heterogeneity observed by clinical imaging and spatial variations in the observed molecular properties of cancer cells. We build on techniques developed in landscape ecology to link regional variations in the distribution of species with local environmental conditions that define their habitat. That is, we view each region of the tumor as a local ecosystem consisting of environmental conditions such as access to nutrients, oxygen, and means of waste clearance related to blood flow and the local population of tumor cells that both adapt to these conditions and, to some extent, change them through, for example, production of angiogenic factors. Furthermore, interactions among neighboring habitats can produce broader regional dynamics so that the internal diversity of tumors is the net result of complex multiscale somatic Darwinian interactions. Methods in landscape ecology harness Darwinian dynamics to link the environmental properties of a given region to the local populations which are assumed to represent maximally fit phenotypes within those conditions. Consider a common task of a landscape ecologist: defining the spatial distribution of species in a large region, e.g., in a satellite image. Clearly the most accurate approach requires a meter by meter survey of the multiple square kilometers in the region of interest. However, this is both impractical and potentially destructive. Instead, landscape ecology breaks the task into component parts relying on the Darwinian interdependence of environmental properties and fitness of specific species’ phenotypic and genotypic properties. First, the satellite map is carefully analyzed to define the number and distribution of habitats. Then the species distribution in a representative sampling of each habitat is empirically determined. Ultimately, this permits sufficient bridging of spatial scales to accurately predict spatial distribution of plant and animal species within large regions. Currently, identifying intratumoral subpopulations requires detailed histological and molecular studies that are expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, this method is subject to sampling bias, is invasive for vital organs such as the brain, and inherently destructive precluding repeated assessments for monitoring post-treatment response and proteogenomic evolution. In contrast, modern cross-sectional imaging can interrogate the entire tumor noninvasively, allowing repeated analysis without disrupting the region of interest. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides exceptional spatial resolution and generates signals that are unique to the molecular constituents of tissue. Here we propose that MRI scans may be the equivalent of satellite images in landscape ecology and, with appropriate application of Darwinian first principles and sophisticated image analytic methods, can be used to estimate regional variations in the molecular properties of cancer cells. We have initially examined this technique in glioblastoma, a malignant brain neoplasm which is morphologically complex and notorious for a fast progression from diagnosis to recurrence and death, making a suitable subject of noninvasive, rapidly repeated assessment of intratumoral evolution. Quantitative imaging analysis of routine clinical MRIs from glioblastoma has identified macroscopic morphologic characteristics which correlate with proteogenomics and prognosis. The key to the accurate detection and forecasting of intratumoral evolution using quantitative imaging analysis is likely to be in the understanding of the synergistic interactions between observable intratumoral subregions and the resulting tumor behavior. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={In recent years, reverse logistic and closed-loop supply chain issues have became more important due to environmental, social and economic reasons. Product recovery which comprises recycling, remanufacturing, repairing and disposing requires an efficient reverse logistic network. Among used products, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a major problem for developing countries due to its harmful effects. WEEE contains hazardous materials that may have an impact on both environment and human health if it is properly managed. On the contrary, valuable materials can be extracted if it is controlled properly. Therefore, decision makers should give consideration to design an efficient reverse logistic network to manage WEEE. In this paper, a mathematical model of two-stage RL network has been developed based on sustainable development objectives in which economic, environmental and social objectives are considered simultaneously. A multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is developed to determine the best locations of collection centres and recycling plants. In result, the decision makers can make the trade-off between environmental issues and economic and social impacts. The proposed model is examined through a real case from Iran's WEEE current situation. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={(Table presented.). Summary: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associate with the vast majority of land plants, providing mutual nutritional benefits and protecting hosts against biotic and abiotic stresses. Significant progress was made recently in our understanding of the genomic organization, the obligate requirements, and the sexual nature of these fungi through the release and subsequent mining of genome sequences. Genomic and genetic approaches also improved our understanding of the signal repertoire used by AM fungi and their plant hosts to recognize each other for the initiation and maintenance of this association. Evolutionary and bioinformatic analyses of host and nonhost plant genomes represent novel ways with which to decipher host mechanisms controlling these associations and shed light on the stepwise acquisition of this genetic toolkit during plant evolution. Mining fungal and plant genomes along with evolutionary and genetic approaches will improve understanding of these symbiotic associations and, in the long term, their usefulness in agricultural settings. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Premise of research. Determining population structure and the spatial distribution of existing genetic variation is important for prioritizing areas for conservation of endangered species. Specifically, identifying clusters of genetically differentiated populations ensures that the genetic diversity of a species is conserved. Scirpus ancistrochaetus, northeastern bulrush, is a federally endangered wetland sedge, found in eight states in the northeastern United States, for which little information on genetic structure is available. Methodology. We collected leaf samples from 96 separate wetlands spanning seven states and representing over half of all known sites (N p 71 sites). We sequenced eight variable loci, which were used to construct distance-based trees and calculate population-assignment probabilities to investigate population structure, and we tested isolation by distance by correlating genetic similarity with geographic distance among populations. Pivotal results. All plants sampled from the same wetland (i.e., a population) were genetically identical with low heterozygosity, and there was little to no variation among clustered wetlands within a site. Scirpus ancistrochaetus was genetically structured across its range. Notably, all populations from New England were genetically identical to each other but differed from all other populations, and a similar pattern was observed for northern Pennsylvania populations. Three genetic clusters were identified, including a primarily New England cluster, a primarily Pennsylvanian cluster, and a southern Appalachian cluster, and overall, genetic distances were consistent with isolation by distance. Although genetic clusters mostly corresponded with geography, some populations did not show this geographic-genetic association, suggesting long-distance dispersal; for example, one population from West Virginia was assigned to the New England cluster. Overall, the highest genetic diversity was found within Pennsylvania and nearby states. Conclusions. Whether similarity between geographically distant locations is due to animal-mediated gene flow or retention of ancestral alleles needs additional study. Additionally, the development of a large number of new markers may help to reveal diversity in areas such as New England with wetlands that did not have any diversity using our markers. Nevertheless, conservation of different genetic clusters at a regional scale is important for maintaining the genetic diversity of S. ancistrochaetus, particularly in its southern range, where the greater amount of genetic diversity suggests that this region is a reservoir of genetic variation. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth’s aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus Malus adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the Iron-Regulated Transporter1 (IRT1) promoter. Specifically, an IRT1 mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased IRT1 expression. The altered IRT1 promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Genetic variation in invasive populations is affected by a variety of processes including stochastic forces, multiple introductions, population dynamics and mating system. Here, we compare genetic diversity between native and invasive populations of the selfing, annual plant Senecio vulgaris to infer the relative importance of genetic bottlenecks, multiple introductions, post-introduction genetic drift and gene flow to genetic diversity in invasive populations. We scored multilocus genotypes at eight microsatellite loci from nine native European and 19 Chinese introduced populations and compared heterozygosity and number of alleles between continents. We inferred possible source populations for introduced populations by performing assignment analyses and evaluated the relative contributions of gene flow and genetic drift to genetic diversity based on correlations of pairwise genetic and geographic distance. Genetic diversity within Chinese populations was significantly reduced compared to European populations indicating genetic bottlenecks accompanying invasion. Assignment tests provided support for multiple introductions with populations from Central China and southwestern China descended from genotypes matching those from Switzerland and the UK, respectively. Genetic differentiation among populations in China and Europe was not correlated with geographic distance. However, European populations exhibited less variation in the relation between GST and geographical distance than populations in China. These results suggest that gene flow probably plays a more significant role in structuring genetic diversity in native populations, whereas genetic drift appears to predominate in introduced populations. High rates of selfing in Chinese populations may restrict opportunities for pollen-mediated gene flow. Repeated colonization-extinction cycles associated with ongoing invasion is likely to maintain low genetic diversity in Chinese populations. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) represents small, random variations in traits, presumably with bilateral symmetry, and is widely used as a tool to measure developmental instability in plants and animals. Because FA is a quick, simple and reliable measure, it has been frequently used for monitoring levels of environmental stress. This study investigated whether FA can be used as a predictor of individual developmental instability for four sympatric Melastomataceae species. To achieve that aim, 20 individuals of Trembleya laniflora, T. parviflora, Lavoisiera campos-portoana and Tibouchina heteromalla were marked in southeastern Brazil and monitored before and during the flowering season. The FA index was calculated as the mean of the difference in the width or length between the left and right sides measured for each leaf or flower. All studied species exhibited asymmetry in the leaves and flowers, but the leaves of L. campos-portoana and the petal width of T. heteromalla exhibited directional asymmetry, also an indicator of developmental instability. The highest level of leaf asymmetry was found in T. heteromalla and on flowers of L. campos-portoana. None of the studied species exhibited a significant relationship between the FA level of the leaves and flowers on an individual basis, indicating that environmental and/or genetic sources of stress might act differently on different plant traits.

abstract={The plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) controls many physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell elongation, seed germination, and response to abiotic stress. In this study, we report that exogenous treatment of flowering Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants with GA specifically affects the process of male meiotic cytokinesis leading to meiotic restitution and the production of diploid (2n) pollen grains. Similar defects in meiotic cell division and reproductive ploidy stability occur in Arabidopsis plants depleted of RGA and GAI, two members of the DELLA family that function as suppressor of GA signaling. Cytological analysis of the double rga-24 gai-t6 mutant revealed that defects in male meiotic cytokinesis are not caused by alterations in meiosis I (MI or meiosis II (MII) chromosome dynamics, but instead result from aberrations in the spatial organization of the phragmoplast-like radial microtubule arrays (RMAs) at the end of meiosis II. In line with a role for GA in the genetic regulation of the male reproductive system, we additionally show that DELLA downstream targets MYB33 and MYB65 are redundantly required for functional RMA biosynthesis and male meiotic cytokinesis. By analyzing the expression of pRGA::GFP-RGA in the wild-type Landsberg erecta background, we demonstrate that the GFP-RGA protein is specifically expressed in the anther cell layers surrounding the meiocytes and microspores, suggesting that appropriate GA signaling in the somatic anther tissue is critical for male meiotic cell wall formation and thus plays an important role in consolidating the male gametophytic ploidy consistency. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Cell signaling pathways mediated by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are essential for plant growth, development, and defense. The EMS1 (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) LRR-RLK and its small protein ligand TPD1 (TAPETUM DETERMINANT1) play a fundamental role in somatic and reproductive cell differentiation during early anther development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, it is unclear whether other cell surface molecules serve as coregulators of EMS1. Here, we show that SERK1 (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1) and SERK2 LRR-RLKs act redundantly as coregulatory and physical partners of EMS1. The SERK1/2 genes function in the same genetic pathway as EMS1 in anther development. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, Förster resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipitation approaches revealed that SERK1 interacted biochemically with EMS1. Transphosphorylation of EMS1 by SERK1 enhances EMS1 kinase activity. Among 12 in vitro autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation sites identified by tandem mass spectrometry, seven of them were found to be critical for EMS1 autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, complementation test results suggest that phosphorylation of EMS1 is required for its function in anther development. Collectively, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence of the interaction and phosphorylation between SERK1/2 and EMS1 in anther development. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Micropropagation is an important tool for the conservation of threatened and commercially important plant species of which orchids deserve special attention. Ansellia africana is one such medicinally important orchid species having much commercial significance. However, for large-scale micropropagation to become not only successful but also acceptable by end-users, somaclonal variations occurring in the plantlets need to be eliminated. In the present study, the clonal integrity of micropropagated A. africana plants derived from two different pathways was assessed using a gene-targeted marker system, i.e. Start Codon Targeted polymorphism (SCoT). Our studies recorded a significantly higher gene flow value (Nm = 1.596) amongst the generations with an increment in clonal variability. The developed protocol helps to understand the main start point of clonal variability in a model tissue culture system and the role played by the various plant growth regulators (PGRs). The protocol also documents a fast and cost-effective regeneration pathway for commercially important medicinal orchids with reproducible molecular detection system to monitor and detect clonal variability for obtaining clonally stable true-to-type plantlets for sustainable commercial use. © 2016 South African Association of Botanists},

abstract={Papaver somniferum is an important medicinal plant, which also has culinary and ornamental significance. We have earlier reported floral homeotic mutants, Pps-1 and OM, which had partially petaloid sepals and sepaloid petals, respectively and thereby showed differential expression of the MADS box genes, PISTILLATA (Paps PI-1) and APETALA-3-1 (Paps AP3-1), in the first two whorls. Here, we report additional floral characters in the OM mutant like modified third whorl (carpeloid stamen) as well as early flowering and cleistogamy. Real-Time PCR analysis indicated that in both, OM mutant and its parent (I-268), the AGAMOUS homologs (PapsAG-1 and PapsAG-2) believed to be involved in the development and identity of the two innermost whorls had higher transcript abundance in the carpels as compared to the stamens. Interestingly, the abundance of AGAMOUS transcripts was found to be higher in the carpeloid stamens of OM vis-a-vis the normal stamens. Presence of major benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in the carpeloid stamens, unlike that in the normal stamens, indicated functional similarities between the carpeloid stamen and the capsule wall. We also report another spontaneous floral homeotic mutant, PS-1 that is early flowering and shows stamens converted into petal-like structures in the third whorl. Genetic divergence of the three homeotic mutants (Pps-1, OM, PS-1), their respective parents (I-14, I-268, I-311) and 22 other genotypes of P. somniferum was studied on the basis of 14 morpho-metric traits, which grouped them into six clusters. PS-1 exhibited maximum genetic divergence among the homeotic mutants. Additionally, it was concluded that hybrids of parents from cluster II (I-268, I-14, Pps-1) and cluster V (OM) would produce most desirable recombinants. These mutants not only serve as models for better understanding the interplay of MADS box genes in flower morphogenesis but also have the potential to be incorporated in further breeding programs for crop improvement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Key message: The number of SNPs required for QTL discovery is justified by the distance at which linkage disequilibrium has decayed. Simulations and real potato SNP data showed how to estimate and interpret LD decay. Abstract: The magnitude of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and its decay with genetic distance determine the resolution of association mapping, and are useful for assessing the desired numbers of SNPs on arrays. To study LD and LD decay in tetraploid potato, we simulated autotetraploid genotypes and used it to explore the dependence on: (1) the number of haplotypes in the population (the amount of genetic variation) and (2) the percentage of haplotype specific SNPs (hs-SNPs). Several estimators for short-range LD were explored, such as the average r2, median r2, and other percentiles of r2 (80, 90, and 95 %). For LD decay, we looked at LD½,90, the distance at which the short-range LD is halved when using the 90 % percentile of r2 at short range, as estimator for LD. Simulations showed that the performance of various estimators for LD decay strongly depended on the number of haplotypes, although the real value of LD decay was not influenced very much by this number. The estimator LD½,90 was chosen to evaluate LD decay in 537 tetraploid varieties. LD½,90 values were 1.5 Mb for varieties released before 1945 and 0.6 Mb in varieties released after 2005. LD½,90 values within three different subpopulations ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 Mb. LD½,90 was 2.5 Mb for introgressed regions, indicating large haplotype blocks. In pericentromeric heterochromatin, LD decay was negligible. This study demonstrates that several related factors influencing LD decay could be disentangled, that no universal approach can be suggested, and that the estimation of LD decay has to be performed with great care and knowledge of the sampled material. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The control of the response of flowering to temperature plays a key role in successful range-expansion of plants. A previous study showed that the suppression of flower-bud formation at high temperature in Taraxacum officinale decreases genetically with latitude from north to south in Japan. The present study investigated whether similar trait variation occurs among populations of native Taraxacum species in Japan. Seedlings of T. albidum (a low- and mid-latitude allopolyploid), T. japonicum (a mid-latitude diploid) and T. venustum (a high-latitude autopolyploid) were grown at three temperatures. Time to flower-bud appearance increased with temperature in T. japonicum and T. venustum, but did not increase in T. albidum. Time to flower-bud appearance did not differ significantly among the three species at 14°C, but it was shorter in T. albidum than in the other two species at 19°C and 24°C. The early appearance of buds of T. albidum was confirmed by another experiment in which plants of 18 populations from the three species and T. platycarpum (a mid-latitude diploid) grown at 19°C were used. The results clearly indicate that high-temperature suppression of flower-bud formation was lower in low-latitude species than in high-latitude species. This interspecific variation is analogous to the intraspecific variation in T. officinale. Time to bud appearance of five populations in T. albidum was homogeneous within and between the populations. The results suggest that the five populations are monoclonal and lack the sensitivity of suppression of flower-bud formation to high temperature. © 2016 The Society for the Study of Species Biology},

abstract={Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used extensively to dissect the genetic regulation of complex traits in plants. These studies have focused largely on the analysis of common genetic variants despite the abundance of rare polymorphisms in several species, and their potential role in trait variation. Here, we conducted the first GWAS in Populus deltoides, a genetically diverse keystone forest species in North America and an important short rotation woody crop for the bioenergy industry. We searched for associations between eight growth and wood composition traits, and common and low-frequency single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected by targeted resequencing of 18 153 genes in a population of 391 unrelated individuals. To increase power to detect associations with low-frequency variants, multiple-marker association tests were used in combination with single-marker association tests. Significant associations were discovered for all phenotypes and are indicative that low-frequency polymorphisms contribute to phenotypic variance of several bioenergy traits. Our results suggest that both common and low-frequency variants need to be considered for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic regulation of complex traits, particularly in species that carry large numbers of rare polymorphisms. These polymorphisms may be critical for the development of specialized plant feedstocks for bioenergy. © 2016 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2016 New Phytologist Trust},

abstract={Protein engineering can provide useful approaches for loop anchoring and mutation of surface-exposed loop residues to Arg for the design of thermostable proteins. In this context and due to the high proportion of surface loops, some of the solvent-exposed residues in the Lampyris turkestanicus luciferase were mutated to Arg. Using the red-emitter mutant luciferase (E354R/Arg356), the single (-Q35R, -I182R, -I232R and -L300R), double (-Q35R/I232R) and triple (-Q35R/I232R/I182R) mutant luciferases were introduced. The relative remaining activity of -I232R, double and triple mutants increased significantly compared to the wild-type at 40 °C. The optimal temperature of these mutants increased up to 40 °C which were 15 °C more than wild-type luciferase. It is anticipated that these mutations increased the local interactions that finally improved the thermostability and optimum temperature of luciferase. It should be noted that Arg substitution at amino acid positions 35, 182 and 232 had no effect on the bioluminescence emission spectra. Furthermore, these mutations have not significantly changed the specific activities of firefly luciferases. Finally, with the use of the homology modeling and molecular docking, the effects of these substitutions were evaluated. In conclusion, this study provides beneficial insights on how the thermal stability of luciferase can be improved by protein engineering for biological applications. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Plants are ideal systems to teach core biology concepts due to their unique physiological and developmental features. Advances in DNA sequencing technology and genomics have allowed scientists to generate genome sequences and transcriptomics data for numerous model plant species. This information is publicly available and presents a valuable tool to introduce undergraduate students to the fundamental concepts of gene expression in the context of modern quantitative biology and bioinformatics. Modern biology classrooms must provide authentic research experiences to allow developing core competencies such as scientific inquiry, critical interpretation of experimental results, and quantitative analyses of large dataset using computational approaches. Recent educational research has shown that undergraduate students struggle when connecting gene expression concepts to classic genetics, phenotypic analyses, and overall flow of biological information in living organisms, suggesting that novel approaches are necessary to enhance learning of gene expression and regulation. This review describes different strategies and resources available to instructors willing to incorporate authentic research experiences, genomic tools, and bioinformatics analyses when teaching transcriptional regulation and gene expression in undergraduate courses. A variety of laboratory exercises and pedagogy materials developed to teach gene expression using plants are discussed.

abstract={Plant secondary metabolites exhibit a variety of biological activities and therefore serve as valuable therapeutics or flavoring compounds. However, the small amounts isolated from plants often cannot meet market demands. This led to the exploration of other, more profitable methods for their production, including plant cell culture systems, chemical synthesis and biotechnological production in microbial hosts. The biotechnological production can be pursued by reconstructing metabolic pathways in selected microbial systems. But due to their complexity, most of these pathways are not completely understood and require the expression of a multitude of genes in a foreign organism. Recently, next generation sequencing data and advances in gene silencing in plants allowed the elucidation of some biosynthetic pathways in more detail. Thus, the de novo production of some natural products, including morphine, strictosidine, artemisinin, taxol® and resveratrol, in extensively engineered microbial hosts has become feasible. This review highlights the reconstruction of these pathways, missing pieces and novel techniques employed. Copyright © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Leaf size and shape play important roles in agronomic traits, such as yield, quality and stress responses. Wide variations in leaf morphological traits exist in cultivated varieties of many plant species. By now, the genetics of leaf shape and size have not been characterized in Brassica napus. In this study, a population of 172 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of leaf morphology traits. Furthermore, fresh young leaves of extreme lines with more leaf lobes (referred to as 'A') and extreme lines with fewer lobes (referred to as 'B') selected from the RIL population and leaves of dissected lines (referred to as 'P') were used for transcriptional analysis. A total of 31 QTLs for the leaf morphological traits tested in this study were identified on 12 chromosomes, explaining 5.32-39.34% of the phenotypic variation. There were 8, 6, 2, 5, 8, and 2 QTLs for PL (petiole length), PN (lobe number), LW (lamina width), LL (Lamina length), LL/LTL (the lamina size ratio) and LTL (leaf total length), respectively. In addition, 74, 1,166 and 1,272 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 'A vs B', 'A vs P' and 'B vs P' comparisons, respectively. The Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to predict the functions of these DEGs. Gene regulators of leaf shape and size, such as ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2, gibberellin 20-oxidase 3, genes encoding gibberellin-regulated family protein, genes encoding growth-regulating factor and KNOTTED1-like homeobox were also detected in DEGs. After integrating the QTL mapping and RNA sequencing data, 33 genes, including a gene encoding auxin-responsive GH3 family protein and a gene encoding sphere organelles protein-related gene, were selected as candidates that may control leaf shape. Our findings should be valuable for studies of the genetic control of leaf morphological trait regulation in B. napus. © 2017 Jian et al.

abstract={Intraspecific variation in plant traits has been clearly shown to drive the structure of associated arthropod communities at the spatial scale of individual plant populations. Nevertheless, it is largely unknown whether plant trait variation among populations drives landscape-scale variation in arthropod communities, and how the strength of such plant genetic effects compares to, and interacts with, those of environmental variation. We documented the structure of arthropod communities on Artemisia californica for two consecutive years in a common garden of plants sourced from five populations along a 5° latitudinal gradient and grown under precipitation treatments approximating the four-fold difference between the north and south range margins for this species. Previous study of plant traits from this garden documented clinal genetic variation, suggesting local adaptation to this environmental gradient, as well as effects of precipitation manipulation that were consistent among populations (i.e., no genotype-by- environment interaction). Within the common garden, arthropod density, evenness, and diversity increased clinally with population source latitude, and arthropod community composition (i.e., species relative abundance) showed a north-south divide. The 2.6-fold cline of northward increase in arthropod density in the common garden was mirrored by a 6.4-fold increase in arthropod density on wild plants sampled along the species range. In contrast to the strong influence of plant genotype, the precipitation manipulation only influenced arthropod community composition, and plant genetic effects on arthropods operated independently of precipitation regime (no genotype-by- environment interaction). Accordingly, we conclude that the strongest driver of landscape-level variation in arthropod communities in this foundational plant species is not variation in the abiotic environment itself, but rather variation in plant traits underlain by the evolutionary process of plant local adaptation. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Salt tolerance genes constitute an important class of loci in plant genomes. Little is known about the extent to which natural selection in saline environments has acted upon these loci, and what types of nucleotide diversity such selection has given rise to. Here, we surveyed genetic diversity in three types of Na+/H+ antiporter gene (SOS, NhaD, and NHX, belonging to the cation/proton antiporter 1 family), which have well-characterized essential roles in plant salt tolerance. Ten Na+/H+ antiporter genes and 16 neutral loci randomly selected as controls were sequenced from 17 accessions of two closely related members of the genus Populus, Populus euphratica and Populus pruinosa, section Turanga, which are native to northwest China. The results show that salt tolerance genes are common targets of natural selection in P. euphratica and P. pruinosa. Moreover, the patterns of nucleotide variation across the three types of Na+/H+ antiporter gene are distinctly different in these two closely related Populus species, and gene flow from P. pruinosa to P. euphratica is highly restricted. Our results suggest that natural selection played an important role in shaping the current distinct patterns of Na+/H+ antiporter genes, resulting in adaptive evolution in P. euphratica and P. pruinosa. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Unidirectional hydrochory, reproduction mode and mating system have different impacts on the ecology of stream plants, and variation in the combination of these processes shapes unique genetic patterns which can have different consequences for the fitness of stream populations. We studied the genetic structure inferred by AFLPs, ITS SNPs and matK sequences of three populations of the common clonal macrophyte Ranunculus baudotii in River Aarhus in order to understand the role of vegetative and sexual reproduction in the stream and how genetic variation is distributed along the stream. We also explored the genetic relationships of the R. baudotii population in River Aarhus with other species of sect. Batrachium, because hybrids have been identified in the stream and they might affect the structure of the populations. The three studied populations were genetically distinct despite low genetic diversity and plant fragmentation is likely the main form of reproduction in the river system. The establishment of a few seeds, sexual recombination, the occurrence of putative hybrids and genetic drift in the establishment of fragments and seeds dramatically changed the genetic diversity of the populations along the stream and led to differentiation among populations. Further research is needed to understand the conditions favoring sexual reproduction and gene flow distances. © 2016},

abstract={Potamogetonaceae is one of the most difficult groups to clarify in aquatic plants. The current studies are mostly concentrated on interspecific identification in Potamogeton. Promising barcoding markers are poor to discriminate intraspecific genetic variety in Potamogeton. In this present study, we tested eight barcoding markers for intraspecific divergence in Potamogeton, including seven cpDNA barcodes (trnL-trnL-trnF, rpl20-rps12, trnG intron, trnH-psbA, matK and rbcL) and two nuclear markers (ITS and PHYB). The results demonstrated that PHYB showed a significantly higher degree of intraspecific divergence in Potamogeton than the others. Five barcodes including trnL-trnL-trnF, trnG intron, matK，rbcL and ITS exhibited a low level of intraspecific variability in Potamogeton. In addition, rpl20-rps12 and trnH-psbA did not show an intraspecific variability in this genus. Thus, PHYB is the most efficient candidate for intraspecific divergence in Potamogeton. This study provides a solid foundation for Potamogeton to explore evolutionary process, and contributes to investigating the relationships between species distribution and geographic arrangement in Potamogeton. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The average nuclear power plant produces twenty metric tons of used nuclear fuel per year, which contains approximately 95 wt% uranium, 1 wt% plutonium, and 4 wt% fission products and transuranic elements. Fast reactors are the preferred option for the transmutation of plutonium and minor actinides; however, an optimistic deployment time of at least 20 years indicates a need for a near-term solution. Previous simulation work demonstrated the potential to transmute transuranic elements in a modified light water reactor fuel pin. This study optimizes a quarter-assembly containing target fuels coated with spectral shift absorbers for the transmutation of plutonium and minor actinides in light water reactors. The spectral shift absorber coating on the target fuel pin tunes the neutron energy spectrum experienced by the target fuel. A coupled model developed using the NEWT module from SCALE 6.1 and a genetic algorithm module from the DAKOTA optimization toolbox provided performance data for the burnup of the target fuel pins in the present study. The optimization with the coupled NEWT/DAKOTA model proceeded in three stages. The first stage optimized a single-target fuel pin per quarter-assembly adjacent to the central instrumentation channel. The second stage evaluated a variety of quarter-assemblies with multiple target fuel pins from the first stage and the third stage re-optimized the pins in the optimal second stage quarter-assembly. An 8 wt% PuZrO2MgO inert matrix fuel pin with a 1.44 mm radius and a 0.06 mm Lu2O3 coating in a five target fuel pin per quarter-assembly configuration represents the optimal combination for the transmutation of plutonium and minor actinides in the LWR environment considered in this study. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Microsatellite-based genetic assignment is used broadly to monitor contemporary effective dispersal among populations. The need to investigate the robustness of this method to common genotyping errors was emphasized more than a decade ago, but it remains unaddressed. We evaluate here for the first time the effect of mistaken and null alleles on estimates of contemporary seed and pollen migration rates obtained with genetic assignment methods. We also introduce a novel Bayesian approach to jointly estimate seed and pollen migration rates, genotyping error rates and null allele frequencies, not requiring independent reference or duplicate genotypic data. Unaccounted-for mistaken alleles caused positive bias and increased the root mean square error (RMSE) of pollen migration rate estimates, whereas seed migration rate estimates were weakly sensitive to mistyping. Jointly estimating mistyping rates minimized the bias and RMSE they introduce on pollen migration estimates, while yielding seed migration rate estimates with similar or slightly larger bias and RMSE than those obtained when ignoring mistyping. Ignoring genotyping errors can be especially problematic when there is no actual migration, because it can lead to the wrong conclusion that there is statistically significant exchange of pollen and/or seeds among populations that are actually isolated. Unaccounted-for null alleles are problematic when among-population pollen dispersal is present, leading to underestimation of pollen migration rates and overestimation of seed migration rates. Jointly estimating null allele frequencies minimized these two biases, reduced the RMSE of seed migration rate estimates and produced relatively small changes in the RMSE of pollen dispersal estimates. Synthesis. Disregarding genotyping errors and null alleles can produce biased and less accurate estimates of the rates at which present-day plant populations are exchanging seed and pollen. An approach is proposed here to minimize the effect of genotyping problems on contemporary migration rate estimates, which should help avoiding erroneous migration inference, monitoring and management, especially when dealing with low migration rates and their associated uncertainty. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Moringa oleifera is the best known species of the Moringaceae family attributed with several medicinal uses and a high nutritional value. This plant is native of the western sub-Himalayan and now is distributed worldwide. The conventional way to propagate Moringa is by seeds, causing its growth to be slow. An alternative to propagate plants in less time and greater number is through plant tissue culture (PTC), which broadly refers to cultivation of plant cells, tissue and organs on artificial medium under aseptic and controlled environmental conditions. Therefore, in this study, an effective system for mass propagation of M. oleifera and the genetic stability with RAMP marker has been implemented. For the propagation, explant of buds and apices of the cotyledon node was used in MS medium and without Plant Growth Regulators (PGR). During indirect regeneration, the best treatment corresponded to the combination of 1 mg L− 1 BA and 0.2 mg L− 1 AIA, which had a maximum of 14 buds per explant; with the same treatment, but using leaves as explants there was mass production of roots. Acclimatization and ground transference of plants into the soil had 95% survival average. DNA from leaves propagated and regenerated and ex vitro plants were used to study genetic variability through Random Amplified Microsatellite Polymorphism (RAMP); the dendrogram of this assay did not show any significant variation between the plants. The in vitro propagation protocols developed here would be useful to obtain mass plants in less time and enhance propagation. © 2016 SAAB},

abstract={Background The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic complex of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, carbohydrates, and collagen that serves as an interface between mammalian cells and their extracellular environment. Essential for normal cellular homeostasis, physiology, and events that occur during development, it is also a key functionary in a number of human diseases including cancer. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum secretes an ECM during multicellular development that regulates multicellularity, cell motility, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis, and provides structural support and protective layers to the resulting differentiated cell types. Proteolytic processing within the Dictyostelium ECM leads to specific bioactive factors that regulate cell motility and differentiation. Scope of review Here we review the structure and functions of the Dictyostelium ECM and its role in regulating multicellular development. The questions and challenges that remain and how they can be answered are also discussed. Major conclusions The Dictyostelium ECM shares many of the features of mammalian and plant ECM, and thus presents an excellent system for studying the structure and function of the ECM. General significance As a genetically tractable model organism, Dictyostelium offers the potential to further elucidate ECM functions, and to possibly reveal previously unknown roles for the ECM. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A set of 14 polymorphic microsatellite markers has been developed and characterized using FIASCO (fast isolation by AFLP of sequences containing repeats) methods for the garden plant, Rhododendron simsii Planch. Forty-one R. simsii individuals showing large morphological differences were used to identify these markers. The total number of alleles for each locus ranged from 2 to 6, with an average value of 3.643. The expected heterozygosities and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.137 to 0.778 and 0.000 to 0.769, respectively. Eight loci exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Among these microsatellites, seven could successfully be transferred to four related species (R. pulchrum, R. hybrida, R. alutaceum and R. molle (Blume) G. Don). These novel microsatellite markers could be further used for assessment of genetic diversity and population structure, phylogeographic analysis and marker-assisted selection for R. simsii and other Rhododendron species. © 2016 The Society for the Study of Species Biology},

abstract={Dispersal ecology is a broad topical discipline that tackles important conceptual and applied issues, such as the study of the ability of plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes. The relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because: (i) dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse (or produce propagules to be dispersed) to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns; (ii) by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry, dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape; and (iii) dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity, such as species assembly in species-rich communities. The steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address conservation issues have expanded the disciplinary boundaries of dispersal ecology. The discussion on the main advances on and challenges for dispersal ecology was the main motivation for the organization of a thematic topic session entitled Dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world at the Annual Meeting of the British Ecological Society (2015, Edinburgh). This session brought together researchers with different types of expertise and interests on dispersal processes and their contributions are now included in this special feature together with a few additional articles. Synthesis. Overall, this special feature illustrates that dispersal ecology spans a broad range of research topics by integrating eight contributions that cover key aspects of this discipline: from conceptual and methodological advances to the study of the ecological and evolutionary outcomes. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Podophyllum species (Podophyllum hexandrum Royle and Podophyllum peltatum) are a major source of deriving anticancer drugs from their major chemical constituent, podophyllotoxin. However, information lacks on regulatory components of podophyllotoxin biosynthesis; therefore, different classes of transcription factors were identified through mining transcriptomes of Podophyllum species and validated through qRT-PCR analysis vis-à-vis podophyllotoxin contents in different tissues/organs of Podophyllum hexandrum. A total of 82, 278, 70, and 90 transcripts were identified in shoots and 89, 273, 72, and 91 transcripts in rhizomes of P. hexandrum transcriptome; 70, 268, 48, and 92 transcripts were in shoots and 58, 245, 41, and 85 transcripts in rhizomes of P. peltatum transcriptome corresponding to bZIP, MYB, WRKY, and bHLH families of transcription factors, which have been shown in regulating biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Two unique transcripts encoding bHLH and MYB/SANT TFs in shoots of P. peltatum (medp_podpe_41091 and medp_podpe_2547) and bZIP and MYB TFs in rhizomes of P. hexandrum (medp_podhe_163581 and medp_podhe_147614) correlated with podophyllotoxin content. Quantification of podophyllotoxin and comparative expression analysis between high (2.51 %) versus low (0.59) podophyllotoxin content accessions revealed 0.04 to ~16-folds increase in transcripts of transcription factors, thereby further supporting the association of identified transcription factors with podophyllotoxin content. bZIP TF showed the highest transcript abundance (19.60-folds) in P. hexandrum rhizomes (2.51 % podophyllotoxin) compared to shoots (0.01 %). In silico analysis of putative promoter regions of pathway genes in other plant species revealed the presence of sequence elements for MYB and WRKY transcription factors, thereby suggesting their role in controlling the production of podophyllotoxin. A repertoire of additional transcription factors has been provided, which can be functionally validated and used in designing a suitable genetic intervention strategy towards enhanced production of podophyllotoxin. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Ambient temperature has a large impact on reproductive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (Hordeum vulgare), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay reproductive development depending on the photoperiod response gene PHOTOPERIOD1 (Ppd-H1) and its upstream regulator EARLY FLOWERING3 (HvELF3). A natural mutation in Ppd-H1 prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type Ppd-H1 or a mutant Hvelf3 allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T1 independently of the genotype. Ppd-H1-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the BARLEY MADS-box genes VERNALIZATION1 (HvVRN1), HvBM3, and HvBM8 in the leaf. Finally, we show that Ppd-H1 interacts with regulatory variation at HvVRN1. Ppd-H1 only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring HvVRN1 allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter Hvvrn1 allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of Ppd-H1. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret fertility in response to ambient temperature in barley. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Although phytohormones such as gibberellins are essential for many conserved aspects of plant physiology and development, plants vary greatly in their responses to these regulatory compounds. Here, we use genetic perturbation of endogenous gibberellin levels to probe the extent of intraspecific variation in gibberellin responses in natural accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We find that these accessions vary greatly in their ability to buffer the effects of overexpression of GA20ox1, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for gibberellin biosynthesis, with substantial differences in bioactive gibberellin concentrations as well as transcriptomes and growth trajectories. These findings demonstrate a surprising level of flexibility in the wiring of regulatory networks underlying hormone metabolism and signaling. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={The Fabaceae (legume family) is the third largest and the second of agricultural importance among flowering plant groups. In this study, we report the reconstruction of a composite comparative map composed of ten legume genomes, including seven species from the galegoid clade (Medicago truncatula, Medicago sativa, Lens culinaris, Pisum sativum, Lotus japonicus, Cicer arietinum, Vicia faba) and three species from the phaseoloid clade (Vigna radiata, Phaseolus vulgaris, Glycine max). To accomplish this comparison, a total of 209 cross-species gene-derived markers were employed. The comparative analysis resulted in a single extensive genetic/genomic network composed of 93 chromosomes or linkage groups, from which 110 synteny blocks and other evolutionary events (e.g., 13 inversions) were identified. This comparative map also allowed us to deduce several large scale evolutionary events, such as chromosome fusion/fission, with which might explain differences in chromosome numbers among compared species or between the two clades. As a result, useful properties of cross-species genic markers were re-verified as an efficient tool for cross-species translation of genomic information, and similar approaches, combined with a high throughput bioinformatic marker design program, should be effective for applying the knowledge of trait-associated genes to other important crop species for breeding purposes. Here, we provide a basic comparative framework for the ten legume species, and expect to be usefully applied towards the crop improvement in legume breeding. © 2016, The Author(s).},

In this study, we characterized differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between maize plants with alternate and opposite phyllotaxies. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that 2432 DEGs were involved in biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and many pathways. Importantly, we identified 19 DEGs related to plant hormone signal transduction. Additionally, we identified four main alternative splicing types: skipped exons, retained introns, alternative 5′-splice sites, and alternative 3′-splice sites, which exhibited different characteristics in the alternate and opposite phyllotaxy libraries. The reliability of the sequencing data was verified through using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis of the 19 genes: 15 were validated to play a role in phytohormone signal transduction pathways. Taken together, our data provide new insight into the mechanisms of phyllotaxy pattern development, and will increase our understanding of how relative changes in gene expression determine alternate/opposite phyllotaxy in maize. © 2016, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer-Science and Media.},

abstract={The populations of wild chili pepper (Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum) are a genetic valuable resource and the knowledge of the germinative ability, is of great importance for its management and conservation. The effects of the temperature on germination of wild chili grown in two environment of light, and the relation with the weight of 100 seeds of five populations of wild chili of the Northwest of Mexico, were recorded. The mother plants grown in greenhouse conditions with 50 and 100 % of solar light. The treatments applied in the germination cameras matched: Fluctuating temperature (25-35 °C) and constant temperature (25 °C). The treatment variables were the following: percentage of final germination and mean germination time (T50). These variables performed a greatest treatment response of fluctuating temperature. A widely variation among 50 and 100 % of light was recorded with natural conditions. These temperature fluctuations are determinant in germinative processes. The temperature performed a significantly response in terms of the effect in germination velocity (T50) but not in germination percentage. The final germination was not significantly correlated with the seed weight due to maternal effects. In addition, plants grown in greenhouse conditions, differentiate among populations with a genetic basis.},

abstract={This study investigated the effects of the sequence arrangement and orientation of a target gene expression cassette in vectors on expression levels to determine the optimal combination for highly efficient multi-gene expression. Five plant transformation vectors were constructed using dual Bt genes, Cry1Ac and Cry3A, which differed in the sequence arrangement and orientation of the target gene expression cassette. Through an Agrobacterium-mediated method, 5 vectors were used for the genetic transformation of tobacco to obtain transgenic lines. Fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that the target genes were expressed at the transcriptional level, which did not differ significantly among the different vectors. However, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that there were significant differences in the toxin expression levels of the different vectors. In vectors N12 and N19, the Cry1Ac gene, located upstream, showed lower average expression than the Cry3A gene, located downstream. Similarly, in vectors N13 and N18, the Cry3A gene, located upstream, had lower expression than the downstream Cry1Ac gene. For vector N21, with the expression cassette containing the Cry1Ac gene located upstream in a trans-arrangement and that of the Cry3A gene located downstream in a cis-arrangement, the Cry1Ac and Cry3A toxin levels were the highest, at 7.41 and 13.24 μg·g− 1, respectively. The insect resistance of transgenic lines transformed by the different vectors was related to the Bt toxin level. Resistance to H. armigera, Lepidoptera, and Cry1Ac toxin level were positively correlated; resistance to A. germari larvae, Coleoptera, and Cry3A toxin content were also positively correlated. This study showed that the sequence arrangement of 2 expression cassettes with target genes may be the key to the target gene expression. Two expression cassettes in the same orientation had little influence on gene expression; however, when the 2 expression cassettes were in the reverse arrangement, the expression of both of the target genes was promoted to a certain extent. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Hitherto, most quantitative trait loci of maize growth and biomass yield have been identified for a single time point, usually the final harvest stage. Through this approach cumulative effects are detected, without considering genetic factors causing phase-specific differences in growth rates. To assess the genetics of growth dynamics, we employed automated non-invasive phenotyping to monitor the plant sizes of 252 diverse maize inbred lines at 11 different developmental time points; 50 k SNP array genotype data were used for genome-wide association mapping and genomic selection. The heritability of biomass was estimated to be over 71%, and the average prediction accuracy amounted to 0.39. Using the individual time point data, 12 main effect marker-trait associations (MTAs) and six pairs of epistatic interactions were detected that displayed different patterns of expression at various developmental time points. A subset of them also showed significant effects on relative growth rates in different intervals. The detected MTAs jointly explained up to 12% of the total phenotypic variation, decreasing with developmental progression. Using non-parametric functional mapping and multivariate mapping approaches, four additional marker loci affecting growth dynamics were detected. Our results demonstrate that plant biomass accumulation is a complex trait governed by many small effect loci, most of which act at certain restricted developmental phases. This highlights the need for investigation of stage-specific growth affecting genes to elucidate important processes operating at different developmental phases. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and the Society for Experimental Biology.},

abstract={Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling transition in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental transition under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target EXPANSIN3 are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the athb5 mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this transition are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling transition in Arabidopsis. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Ophiorrhiza mungos is a herbaceous medicinal plant which contains a quinoline alkaloid, camptothecin (CPT), an anticancer compound. A high-yielding cell line, O. mungos cell line-3 (OMC3) was selected from cell suspension cultures of O. mungos using cell aggregate cloning method and established cell suspension culture. OMC3 cell suspension produced significantly high biomass (9.25 ± 1.3 g/flask fresh weight (FW)) and CPT yield (0.095 ± 0.002 mg g−1 dry weight (DW)) compared with the original cell suspension. Inoculum size of OMC3 cell suspension culture was optimised as 14 g L−1. Media optimisation has shown that 5 % (w/v) sucrose and an increased ammonium/nitrate concentration of 40/20 mM favoured CPT production, whereas 3 % (w/v) sucrose, an ammonium/nitrate concentration of 20/40 mM and 1.25 mM of phosphate favoured biomass accumulation. Jasmonic acid, chitin and salicylic acid was used to elicit CPT production in the original cell suspension culture and achieved significantly high CPT production with jasmonic acid (JA) elicitation. Further, OMC3 cell suspension culture was elicited with JA (50 μM) and obtained 1.12 ± 0.08 mg g−1 DW CPT and 9.52 ± 1.4 g/flask FW (190.4 g L−1 FW). The combination of cell line selection and elicitation has produced 18.66-fold increases in CPT production together with significantly high biomass yield. The study is helpful in the scale-up studies of O. mungos cell suspension culture in suitable bioreactor systems for the production of CPT. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A transgene-expression system for wheat that relies on the complementation of inactive precursor protein fragments through a split-intein system is described. The N-and C-terminal fragments of a barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquifaciens were fused to intein sequences from Synechocystis sp. and transformed into wheat plants. Upon translation, both barnase fragments are assembled by an autocatalytic intein-mediated trans-splicing reaction, thus forming a cytotoxic enzyme. This chapter focuses on the use of introns and flexible polypeptide linkers to foster the expression of a split-barnase expression system in plants. The methods and protocols that were employed with the objective to test the effects of such genetic elements on transgene expression and to find the optimal design of expression vectors for use in wheat are provided. Split-inteins can be used to form an agriculturally important trait (male sterility) in wheat plants. The use of this principle for the production of hybrid wheat seed is described. The suggested toolbox will hopefully be a valuable contribution to future optimization strategies in this commercially important crop. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={Prunus avium is primarily cultivated for its fruit, sweet cherries. However, it is also used to produce high-quality timber. In a P. avium seed orchard, gametophytic self-incompatibility is a restriction for free pollen flow and should be considered when establishing basic forest materials. In this study, S-locus diversity and cross-incompatibility of wild cherry individuals in clonal banks established for breeding for timber production were investigated. Wild cherry trees (140) with outstanding forest growth habit, collected in northern Spain, grafted and planted in two clonal banks, were genotyped at the S-locus. The self-incompatibility S-locus genes, S-RNase and SFB, were analysed by PCR. Twenty-two S-haplotypes, resulting in 72 different S-genotypes, were identified. The genotypes were grouped into 33 incompatibility groups and 39 unique genotypes. This initial S-locus analysis revealed large genetic diversity of wild cherry trees from the Spanish northern deciduous forest, and provides useful information for seed orchard design. Wild P. avium displays significantly more genetic diversity than what is detected in local cultivars, revealing a narrowing of genetic diversity during local domestication. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Texas wild rice (Zizania texana) is an endangered, aquatic perennial plant endemic to the upper section of the San Marcos River, Texas. Ex situ populations of Z. texana are maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the event of a catastrophe event. We analyzed the genetics of in situ and ex situ populations of Z. texana to address the following questions: (1) are in situ populations adequately represented in ex situ population? (2) Is there genetic diversity among the current in situ population? (3) Has the current in situ genetic diversity increased or decreased from historical estimates in 2007. Results indicated that the overall ex situ populations were lower in genetic (allelic) diversity compared to the in situ population, with some in situ populations not present in the refugia. Overall, heterozygosity was moderate and ranged from HO = 0.530 to HO = 0.635 in the wild and HO = 0.549 to HO = 0.727 in the ex situ population. Inbreeding coefficients (FIS) were near zero or negative indicating that inbreeding is not common within the current populations (in situ and ex situ) suggesting that some populations have an excess of heterozygotes (negative FIS). Analysis of current in situ population structure indicated there are three unique genetic clusters in the San Marcos River. Comparison of the in situ population with historical analysis indicates the genetic diversity of the wild population is dynamic both temporally and spatially. The results indicate that Z. texana exhibits a plastic reproductive system utilizing both asexual (vegetative) and sexual (flowering and seed production) reproduction. © 2015},

abstract={Most perennial herbaceous plants are able to reproduce vegetatively as well as sexually. Sometimes, such plants may lose the capacity for sexual reproduction. We have studied the case of sterility in triploid populations (2n = 3x = 45) of Gladiolus tenuis M.Bieb. in a considerable part of its area of distribution. Initially, we recorded the presence of a large clone of G. tenuis to the east of the Volga River, as a result of isozyme analysis. We also used AFLP fingerprinting to genotype 55 samples from 10 populations of G. tenuis and one population of the closely related G. imbricutus L. This analysis revealed an extremely low genetic diversity in sterile triploid populations of G. tenuis and a rather high genetic diversity in fertile tetraploid populations (2n = 4x = 60) over most of the area of this species. Genetic distances between fertile and sterile populations of G. tenuis were similar to those between different species of gladioli. It appears that a single sterile genotype has spread vegetatively over 800 km, propagating by daughter corms. The study of the reproductive features of G. tenuis suggests that the cause of sterility may be self-incompatibility between individuals of the clone. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Orchids are highly dependent on their mycorrhizal fungal partners for nutrient supply, especially during early developmental stages. In addition to organic carbon, nitrogen (N) is probably a major nutrient transferred to the plant because orchid tissues are highly N-enriched. We know almost nothing about the N form preferentially transferred to the plant or about the key molecular determinants required for N uptake and transfer. We identified, in the genome of the orchid mycorrhizal fungus Tulasnella calospora, two functional ammonium transporters and several amino acid transporters but found no evidence of a nitrate assimilation system, in agreement with the N preference of the free-living mycelium grown on different N sources. Differential expression in symbiosis of a repertoire of fungal and plant genes involved in the transport and metabolism of N compounds suggested that organic N may be the main form transferred to the orchid host and that ammonium is taken up by the intracellular fungus from the apoplatic symbiotic interface. This is the first study addressing the genetic determinants of N uptake and transport in orchid mycorrhizas, and provides a model for nutrient exchanges at the symbiotic interface, which may guide future experiments. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Hyperhydricity occurs frequently in plant tissue culture and can severely affect commercial micropropagation and genetic improvement of the cultured plantlets. Hyperhydric shoots are charaterzized by high water content, but how this occurs is still a subject of investigation. Silver ion (Ag+) can reduce the extent of hyperhydricity in plants, but its effect on the reversion of hyperhydric plantlets and the underlying mechanism of reversion has not been clarified. In this study, about 67% of the hyperhydric Dianthus chinensis L. plantlets were found to revert to normal condition when the plantlets were cultured in medium supplemented with 29.4 μmol L−1AgNO3. Water content and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in the guard cells of these plantlets were reduced, while stomatal aperture and water loss rate were increased. AgNO3 also reduced the content of endogenous ethylene and expression of ethylene synthesis and ethylene signal transduction-associated genes. Reduced accumulation of ethylene consequently led to an increase in stomatal aperture mediated by decreased H2O2 content in the guard cells. These results adequately verified the role of AgNO3 in the reversion of hyperhydricity in D. chinensis L. and also provided clues for exploring the cause of excessive water accumulation in hyperhydric plants. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of HR1, HR2, or HR3 led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of HR2 or HR3 resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these RPW8 homologs contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from Brassica oleracea tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of many lineages. With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Essential oils from this crop found a wide range of application including medicine, perfumery, ornamental, flavouring and therapeutic uses in pharmaceuticals and is emerging crop for bio fuel production. Many species of Cymbopogon cultivated worldwide but their identification is somewhat difficult since they do not have suitable genomic diversity information. Assessment of genetic diversity is therefore essential for conservation and management of this species. A total of 20 Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 15 Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) primers were examined, of which 26 primers (13 RAPD and 13 ISSR) showed amplification and were used for further study. Unweighted Pair Group Method of Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) derived dendrogram in both the analysis was more or less similar and cluster analysis (CA) based on RAPD, ISSR and their combined data clearly discriminated the genotypes into different clusters. Result of principal component analysis (PCA) was in agreement with cluster analysis with a few exceptions.

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been implicated in these RNA-protein interactions. Maize defective kernel 2 (dek2) is a classic mutant with small kernels and delayed development. Through positional cloning and allelic confirmation, we found Dek2 encodes a novel P-type PPR protein that targets mitochondria. Mitochondrial transcript analysis indicated that dek2 mutation causes reduced splicing efficiency of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1. Mitochondrial complex analysis in dek2 immature kernels showed severe deficiency of complex I assembly. Dramatically up-regulated expression of alternative oxidases (AOXs), transcriptome data, and TEM analysis results revealed that proper splicing of nad1 is critical for mitochondrial functions and inner cristaes morphology. This study indicated that Dek2 is a new PPR protein that affects the splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 and is required for mitochondrial function and kernel development. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={Calcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger in several signaling pathways in plants. The calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) represent a family of plant calcium-binding proteins that function in propagating Ca2+ signals by interacting with CBL interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Phosphorylation of CBL by CIPK is essential for the module to display full activity towards its target protein. Previous genetic analysis showed that the function of CBL9-CIPK3 module was implicated in negatively regulating seed germination and early development. In the present study, we have biochemically investigated the interaction of CBL9-CIPK3 module and our findings show that CBL9 is phosphorylated by CIPK3. Moreover, Abscisic acid repressor 1 (ABR1) is identified as the downstream target of CIPK3 and CIPK3-ABR1 function to regulate ABA responses during seed germination. Our study also indicates that the role of ABR1 is not limited to seed germination but it also regulates the ABA dependent processes in the adult stage of plant development. Combining our results, we conclude that the CBL9-CIPK3-ABR1 pathway functions to regulate seed germination and ABA dependent physiological processes in Arabidopsis. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={The components of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway have been well characterized in heterotrophic organisms from yeast to humans. However, because of rapamycin insensitivity, embryonic lethality in tor null mutants and a lack of reliable ways of detecting TOR protein kinase in higher plants, the key players upstream and downstream of TOR remain largely unknown in plants. Using engineered rapamycin-sensitive Binding Protein 12-2 (BP12-2) plants, the present study showed that combined treatment with rapamycin and active-site TOR inhibitors (asTORis) results in synergistic inhibition of TOR activity and plant growth in Arabidopsis. Based on this system, we revealed that TOR signaling plays a crucial role in modulating the transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) was identified as a direct downstream target of TOR, and the growth of TOR-suppressed plants could be rescued by up-regulating S6K2. Systems, genetic, and biochemical analyses revealed that Brassinosteriod Insensitive 2 (BIN2) acts as a novel downstream effector of S6K2, and the phosphorylation of BIN2 depends on TOR-S6K2 signaling in Arabidopsis. By combining pharmacological with genetic and biochemical approaches, we determined that the TOR-S6K2-BIN2 signaling pathway plays important roles in regulating the photoautotrophic growth of Arabidopsis. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Phenotypic and genotypic diversity as well as symbiotic effectiveness of twenty one symbionts isolated from nodules of four Acacia species (Acacia melanoxylon, A. mearnsii, A. saligna and Acacia tortillis) grown in Morocco were evaluated. Growth in various media (YMA, YMA-BBT, YMA-RC), colony morphology, tolerance to stress factors (temperature, pH, salt concentrations, various heavy metals) and different carbon sources were used as phenotypic markers. The genetic characterization was studied by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The symbμotic effectiveness of rhizobial isolates on acacia was evaluated using plant nodulation assay in controlled conditions. Results showed that twelve isolates were fast growing, all of the twenty one isolates tolerated pH between 4.8 and 8.8 and temperatures of 14, 22, 28, and 37°C, while only five could grow at 44°C and three at 55°C. Highest resistance to heavy metals was recorded for arsenate, mercury, chromium; in contrast, low resistance was noted for copper (15 isolates resisted to10 μg mL-1). Most of the isolates were able to grow in a wide range of carbohydrates. The genotypic analysis of the tested isolates showed that they could be regrouped into three principal clusters based on their RAPD profiles. Acacia saligna was principally nodulated by Bradyrhizobium sp. while the other species were nodulated by different rhizobial species. Both phenotypic and genotypic studies showed great rhizobial isolate’s diversity. The symbiotic effectiveness tests showed that two isolates (AsF and AsAg1) had high N2fixing potential on Acacia saligna. © 2017, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Chromosome doubling of Italian ryegrass genotypes (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) adapted to the brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions is an important strategy used by breeders and aims to obtain more vigorous genotypes with better forage quality and disease resistance. The effectiveness of chromosome doubling can be measured by genetic stability and fertility rates of plants over generations. However, a common problem in the polyploidization process is the regeneration of mixoploid plants that have impaired fertility and genetic stability. The objective of this study was to verify if progenies of recently tetraploidized plants remain stable regarding DNA content and chromosome number, over two generations. Progenies of L. multiflorum plants artificially tetraploidized with colchicine treatment were evaluated. Chromosome counting and estimates of the DNA content were used to evaluate the genetic stability. The percentage of tetraploid plants (4X) increased over generations (18%, 34% and 91% in cycle 0, 1 and 2, respectively). All progenies identified as tetraploid by flow citometry showed variation in chromosome number (mixoploidy), but produced viable seeds. Results showed that stabilization in chromosome number and DNA content in tetraploidized plant progenies requires time and that the success of this procedure depends on a continuous and accurate screening and selection. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

abstract={Energy, Exergy, Exergoeconomic and Environmental (4E) analysis of combined cycle power plant utilizing the method of steam injection into the combustion chamber is performed in the current study. Steam is supplied from low pressure (LP) side of the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). According to genetic algorithm's results, the steam injection elevates the total combined cycle power by 2 MW while lowers the design costs considerably at optimum state. Some parameters restrict the steam injection usage within combined cycles that could be noted as Gas turbine power decline; Gas turbine loss increase due to pressure loss; HRSG's manufacturing costs growth; opposition between high and low pressure flow rate variations; NOX and CO emission costs dependency on optimum conditions. This paper discusses the above limitations for implementation of such technology in combined cycles. At the optimum point, Exergy and thermal efficiencies values increased from 42% and 47.6% to 47.28% and 48.94% respectively. Optimum pinch and approach temperatures for HP and LP sides were computed to be 35, 20, 17 and 37.5, respectively. Also, the optimum value of X parameter is 23.28%; X is defined as the ratio of steam to the inlet air flow rate divided by the other fraction which is the ratio of fuel to input air flow rate while there is no steam injection into the combustion chamber. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The DNA damage response (DDR) is induced by various DNA damaging factors and maintains genome stability in all organisms. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome contains putative homologous genes involved in DDR; however, little is known about the functions and responses of these genes to DNA damage. In this study, DDR by gamma radiation was determined in C. reinhardtii. Irradiation with 80, and 200 Gy gamma radiation caused death in approximately 47 and 97 % of C. reinhardtii cells, respectively. The absolute lethality of cells was at 300 Gy. The rate of DNA breaks was also determined using comet assays after exposure to different doses of gamma radiation. Irradiation with 80 and 400 Gy resulted in 17 and 34 % of nuclear degradation in C. reinhardtii cells, respectively. To identify the major DDR pathway of C. reinhardtii induced by gamma radiation, 24 putative DDR genes were selected from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) database. Gamma radiation significantly affected expression of 15 genes among these. Therefore, these genes displaying expressional changes by gamma radiation are involved in DDR, which indicate that C. reinhardtii may possess a fundamental conserved DDR pathway with higher plants. Furthermore, radiation responsive proteins were identified by proteomic analysis, which are involved in metabolisms of carbohydrate, energy, and photosynthesis. This is the first report to describe the responses of DDR homologous genes to gamma radiation and to identify gamma radiation-responsive proteins in C. reinhardtii. Our data should provide molecular insights into gamma radiation responses including DNA damage in green algae. © 2016, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer-Science and Media.},

abstract={Most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated plasma membrane (PM) proteins for vacuolar degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues. This process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of ESCRTs in plants. Here, we studied the function of one ESCRT-II component, VPS36, which shows ubiquitin-binding activity and may form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Recessive mutation of the ubiquitously expressed VPS36 causes multiple defects, including delayed embryogenesis, defective root elongation, and limited expansion of cotyledons, and these effects can be complemented by its genomic DNA. Abnormal intracellular compartments containing several membrane transporters, including members of the PIN-FORMEDs, AUXIN RESISTANT 1, and PIP1 families, were found in vps36-1 plants. Employing a genetic approach to cross vps36-1/+ with transgenic plants harboring various fluorescent protein-tagged organelle markers, as well as fluorescent probe and ultrastructural approaches, revealed PM proteins in microsomal fractions from vps36-1 seedlings and demonstrated that VPS36 is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and vacuolar biogenesis for protein degradation. Our study shows that functional VPS36 is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for vacuolar biogenesis in Arabidopsis. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Phospholipase D (PLD) and its product phosphatidic acid (PA) are emerging as essential regulators of cytoskeleton organization in plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PA-mediated microtubule reorganization in plants remain largely unknown. In this study, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches to analyze the function of Arabidopsis thaliana PLDα1 in the regulation of microtubule organization and cell development in response to microtubule-affecting drugs. Treatment with the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel resulted in less growth inhibition and decreased rightward slant of roots, longitudinal alignment of microtubules, and enhanced length of hypocotyl epidermal cells in the pldα1 mutant, the phenotype of which was rescued by exogenous application of PA. Moreover, the pldα1 mutant was sensitive to the microtubule-disrupting drugs oryzalin and propyzamide in terms of seedling survival ratio, left-skewing angle of roots and microtubule organization. In addition, both disruption and stabilization of microtubules induced by drugs activated PLDα1 activity. Our findings demonstrate that in A. thaliana, PLDα1/PA might regulate cell development by modulating microtubule organization in an activity-dependent manner. © 2016, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.},

abstract={Hybrid necrosis is a common type of hybrid incompatibility in plants. This phenomenon is caused by deleterious epistatic interactions, resulting in spontaneous activation of plant defenses associated with leaf necrosis, stunted growth and reduced fertility in hybrids. Specific combinations of alleles of ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) have been shown to be a common cause of hybrid necrosis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Increased ACD6 activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against biotrophic pathogens but reduces biomass production. We generated 996 crosses among individuals derived from a single collection area around Tübingen (Germany) and screened them for hybrid necrosis. Necrotic hybrids were further investigated by genetic linkage, amiRNA silencing, genomic complementation and metabolic profiling. Restriction site associated DNA (RAD)-sequencing was used to understand genetic diversity in the collection sites containing necrosis-inducing alleles. Novel combinations of ACD6 alleles found in neighbouring stands were found to activate the A. thaliana immune system. In contrast to what we observed in controlled conditions, necrotic hybrids did not show reduced fitness in the field. Metabolic profiling revealed changes associated with the activation of the immune system in ACD6-dependent hybrid necrosis. This study expands our current understanding of the active role of ACD6 in mediating trade-offs between defense responses and growth in A. thaliana. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Iris series Hexagonae is a small, monophyletic complex of five species and associated hybrid populations, popularly known as the 'Louisiana irises'. Series Hexagonae has been recognized as a textbook case of introgressive hybridization based on numerous studies in Louisiana. We previously explored patterns of genetic structure and diversity in populations of the complex in Florida. Populations that occupy high, dry habitats have plants with a distinctive floral 'highlands' phenotype. Aquatic populations of I. savannarum also have a consistent floral phenotype ('coastal'). Jacks Branch slough in Glades County harbors the largest population of series Hexagonae sampled in our previous studies. It is an ecologically heterogeneous site, punctuated by sandy uplands that remain above high water and harbor Iris with the highlands floral phenotype as well as coastal types in the wetter areas of the slough. We hypothesized that mesic, but non-inundated, sites in the slough would host hybrids of the two phenotypic groups, and tested these hypotheses with 19 microsatellite loci. All data analyses support our hypothesis of hybridization between the upland and hydric subpopulations. Although two methods of introgression analysis identify some of the individuals from the admixture zone as first-generation hybrids, subsequent admixture was asymmetric with introgression from the 'highland' parent. This is the first report of such assortative processes occurring in the confines of a single population of Iris. We suggest that the evolutionary processes described interspecifically for series Hexagonae commence early at the population level. © 2017 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.},

abstract={Quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification in perennial fruit crops is impeded largely by their lengthy generation time, resulting in costly and labor-intensive maintenance of breeding programs. In a grapevine (genus Vitis) breeding program, although experimental families are typically unreplicated, the genetic backgrounds may contain similar progenitors previously selected due to their contribution of favorable alleles. In this study, we investigated the utility of joint QTL identification provided by analyzing half-sib families. The genetic control of powdery mildew was studied using two half-sib F1 families, namely GE0711/1009 (MN1264 × MN1214; N = 147) and GE1025 (MN1264 × MN1246; N = 125) with multiple species in their ancestry. Maternal genetic maps consisting of 1077 and 1641 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, respectively, were constructed using a pseudo-testcross strategy. Ratings of field resistance to powdery mildew were obtained based on whole-plant evaluation of disease severity. This 2-year analysis uncovered two QTLs that were validated on a consensus map in these half-sib families with improved precision relative to the parental maps. Examination of haplotype combinations based on the two QTL regions identified strong association of haplotypes inherited from ‘Seyval blanc’, through MN1264, with powdery mildew resistance. This investigation also encompassed the use of microsatellite markers to establish a correlation between 206-bp (UDV-015b) and 357-bp (VViv67) fragment sizes with resistance-carrying haplotypes. Our work is one of the first reports in grapevine demonstrating the use of SNP-based maps and haplotypes for QTL identification and tagging of powdery mildew resistance in half-sib families. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The initiation of flowering is tightly regulated by the endogenous and environment signals, which is crucial for the reproductive success of flowering plants. It is well known that autonomous and vernalization pathways repress transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a focal floral repressor, but how its protein stability is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we found that mutations in a novel Arabidopsis SUMO protease 1 (ASP1) resulted in a strong late-flowering phenotype under long-days, but to a lesser extent under short-days. ASP1 localizes in the nucleus and exhibited a SUMO protease activity in vitro and in vivo. The conserved Cys-577 in ASP1 is critical for its enzymatic activity, as well as its physiological function in the regulation of flowering time. Genetic and gene expression analyses demonstrated that ASP1 promotes transcription of positive regulators of flowering, such as FT, SOC1 and FD, and may function in both CO-dependent photoperiod pathway and FLC-dependent pathways. Although the transcription level of FLC was not affected in the loss-of-function asp1 mutant, the protein stability of FLC was increased in the asp1 mutant. Taken together, this study identified a novel bona fide SUMO protease, ASP1, which positively regulates transition to flowering at least partly by repressing FLC protein stability. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Global change is generating widespread local-scale expansions of tree populations. During demographic expansions, even small differences in individual reproductive success can generate large differences in the genetic composition of the resulting population. Colonizing tree populations almost invariably show highly skewed distributions of seed production, but the evolution of this reproductive skew during plant recruitment remains understudied. We examine how recruit mortality modifies initial patterns of acorn dispersal and maternal reproductive success in a recently established, expanding Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forest stand and test different predictors of successful recruit establishment. We mapped and genotyped a cohort of seedlings (n = 809) emerging within and around the stand (n = 254 adult trees), identified their habitats and monitored their fate until an age of 3 years. Their mother trees were inferred by Bayesian parentage analysis, and the number of assigned descendants was used as a proxy for tree maternal fertility. We examined temporal trends in tree fertility and patterns of dispersal, and tested effects of seed number-quality trade-offs, dispersal failure, dispersal distance and habitat of propagule arrival on the probability of seedling establishment. We observed marked inequality in maternal reproductive success at the time of seedling emergence. A positive relationship between tree fertility and the proportion of non-dispersed seedlings pointed to disperser satiation. An overall seedling mortality of 69% generated considerable reshuffling in the fertility ranking of individual trees. Non-dispersal more than doubled seedling mortality. The establishment success of actually dispersed seedlings was independent of mother fertility and dispersal distance but strongly related to the habitat of arrival. Recruit survival was markedly higher in pine plantations or non-forested areas than in broadleaved forest. Synthesis. A few highly fertile trees dominated reproduction in the stand. Differential recruitment success tended to reduce their initial advantage, however, suggesting that reproductive inequality might rapidly decline as more trees start to reproduce along the expansion process. Our results also suggest that field estimates of size or seed production are unlikely to provide reliable estimates of lifetime reproductive success in trees. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Premise of the study: Microsatellite primers were developed for Viscum coloratum (Santalaceae), a semiparasitic medicinal plant that is known for its anticancer properties. Due to excessive human harvesting and loss of suitable habitat of its populations, it has become a potentially threatened species requiring immediate conservation efforts. Methods and Results: Based on transcriptome data for V. coloratum, 124 primer pairs were randomly selected for initial validation, of which 19 yielded polymorphic microsatellite loci, with two to six alleles per locus. The usefulness of these markers was assessed for 60 individuals representing three populations of V. coloratum. Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.033 to 0.833 and 0.032 to 0.672, respectively. Cross-species amplification for 19 loci in the related species V. album was conducted. Conclusions: The 19 newly developed loci are expected to be useful for studying the population genetics and ecological conservation of V. coloratum. © 2017 Tabay et al.

abstract={Tomato bacterial spot is caused by Xanthomonas euvesicatoria, X. vesicatoria, X. perforans and X. gardneri. In order to determine the distribution, frequency of occurrence, and diversity of these species in the Brazilian commercial tomato fields, a survey was conducted between 2009 and 2012. In this period, 204 strains were obtained from 33 counties (22 with processing tomatoes and 11 with fresh-market tomatoes). Pathogenicity tests, BOX-PCR, PCR with species-specific primers, and sequence analysis of the avirulence gene avrXv3 were performed in order to identify the strains at species and race level. Xanthomonas perforans predominated among the strains (92%) and was present in most counties. In addition, this species was prevalent in most areas of both fresh-market tomatoes (63.6% of counties surveyed) and processing tomatoes (95.4% of counties surveyed). Fifteen strains (7.5%) were identified as X. gardneri, which was found mostly in fresh-market fields located at regions with altitude higher than 900 m, and only one strain of X. euvesicatoria (0.5%) was found in a processing tomato field. High genetic diversity was observed within X. perforans, with 137 BOX-PCR haplotypes. Race T3 prevailed (97.5%), but reported here for the first time is the occurrence of five strains identified as race T4 in fresh-market fields in the state of São Paulo. The race T4 phenotype of these strains resulted from the presence of an 859 bp insertion in the avirulence gene avrXv3. This insertion is related to amino acid sequences of a transposase found in X. gardneri, and to amino acid sequences of X. campestris. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology},

abstract={The genetic breakdown of self-incompatibility (SI) and subsequent mating system shifts to inbreeding has intrigued evolutionary geneticists for decades. Most of our knowledge is derived from interspecific comparisons between inbreeding species and their outcrossing relatives, where inferences may be confounded by secondary mutations that arose after the initial loss of SI. Here, we study an intraspecific breakdown of SI and its consequences in North American Arabidopsis lyrata to test whether: (1) particular S-locus haplotypes are associated with the loss of SI and/or the shift to inbreeding; (2) a population bottleneck may have played a role in driving the transition to inbreeding; and (3) the mutation(s) underlying the loss of SI are likely to have occurred at the S-locus. Combining multiple approaches for genotyping, we found that outcrossing populations on average harbour 5 to 9 S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) alleles, but only two, S1 and S19, are shared by most inbreeding populations. Self-compatibility (SC) behaved genetically as a recessive trait, as expected from a loss-of-function mutation. Bulked segregant analysis in SC × SI F2 individuals using deep sequencing confirmed that all SC plants were S1 homozygotes but not all S1 homozygotes were SC. This was also revealed in population surveys, where only a few S1 homozygotes were SC. Together with crossing data, this suggests that there is a recessive factor that causes SC that is physically unlinked to the S-locus. Overall, our results emphasise the value of combining classical genetics with advanced sequencing approaches to resolve long outstanding questions in evolutionary biology. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in Brachypodium distachyon, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (Triticum spp.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated B. distachyon colocalize with VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C and VERNALIZATION2, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Biological effect directed in vivo tests with model organisms are useful in assessing potential health risks associated with chemical contaminations in surface waters. This study examined the applicability of two in vivo test systems viz. plant, Allium cepa root based tests and fish, Oreochromis niloticus erythrocyte based tests for screening cytogenotoxic potential of raw source water, water treatment waste (effluents) and treated water of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) using two DWTPs associated with a major river in Sri Lanka. Measured physico-chemical parameters of the raw water, effluents and treated water samples complied with the respective Sri Lankan standards. In the in vivo tests, raw water induced statistically significant root growth retardation, mitodepression and chromosomal abnormalities in the root meristem of the plant and micronuclei/nuclear buds evolution and genetic damage (as reflected by comet scores) in the erythrocytes of the fish compared to the aged tap water controls signifying greater genotoxicity of the source water especially in the dry period. The effluents provoked relatively high cytogenotoxic effects on both test systems but the toxicity in most cases was considerably reduced to the raw water level with the effluent dilution (1:8). In vivo tests indicated reduction of cytogenotoxic potential in the tested drinking water samples. The results support the potential applications of practically feasible in vivo biological test systems such as A. cepa root based tests and the fish erythrocyte based tests as complementary tools for screening cytogenotoxicity potential of the source water and water treatment waste reaching downstream of aquatic ecosystems and for evaluating cytogenotoxicity eliminating efficacy of the DWTPs in different seasons in view of human and ecological safety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are functionally divided into two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora1 and Aurora2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available on the role of Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H3 and the plant homolog of TPX2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-1—a member of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 protein family, implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants—is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP65-1 interacts with Aurora1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule bundling capacity of MAP65-1 in concert with other mitotic kinases. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Plant germination and development depend upon a seed's successful dispersal into a suitable habitat and its ability to grow and survive within the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. The seeds of Aechmea mertensii, a tank-bromeliad species, are dispersed by either Camponotus femoratus or Neoponera goeldii, two ant species that initiate ant gardens (AGs). These two mutualistic ant species influence the vegetative and reproductive traits of the bromeliad through their divergent ecological preferences (i.e. light and substrate). We hypothesised that the seeds dispersed by these two ant species have underlying genetic differences affecting germination, growth and survival of A. mertensii seedlings in different ways. To test this, we used an experimental approach consisting of sowing seeds of A. mertensii: (i) taken from the two AG–ant associations (i.e. seed origin), (ii) in two contrasting light conditions, and (iii) on three different substrates. Light and substrate had significant effects on germination, survival and on eight key leaf traits reflecting plant performance. Seed origin had a significant effect only on germination and on two leaf traits (total dry mass and relative growth rate). Overall, this bromeliad performs better (i.e. high growth and survival rates) when growing both in the shade and in the carton nest developed by C. femoratus ants. These results suggest that the plasticity of the tank bromeliad A. mertensii is mainly due to environment but also to genetic differences related to seed origin, as some traits are heritable. Thus, these two ant species may play contrasting roles in shaping plant evolution and speciation. © 2016 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands},

In the palm collection work, the color of unripe fruit bunch type green, represents the 4.5% of the population, 5.3% of the palms are prolific type and 6.4% performs a hermaphrodite flowering stage. No androgynous palm inflorescence were recorded. 87% of the palm collection have allowed to establish inflorescence with 25% of enclosure fibers, which represents 75% bunch exposure.

abstract={(Table presented.). Summary: Understanding the genetic bases of complex traits has been a main challenge in biology for decades. Comparative phylogenomics offers an opportunity to identify candidate genes associated with these complex traits. This approach initially developed in prokaryotes consists in looking at shared coevolution between genes and traits. It thus requires a precise reconstruction of the trait evolution, a large genomic sampling in the clades of interest and an accurate definition of orthogroups. Recently, with the growing body of sequenced plant genomes, comparative genomics has been successfully applied to plants to study the widespread arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here I will use these findings to illustrate the main principles of comparative phylogenomic approaches and propose directions to improve our understanding of symbiotic associations. © 2016 The Author.

abstract={Premise of the study: The search for resistance/tolerance to the devastating citrus huanglongbing disease (syn. HLB or citrus greening) is generating an increasing number of new plants of diverse genetic makeup. As the increasing number of new plants require more space, resources, and time, the need for faster and more efficient HLB screening tests becomes crucial. Methods and Results: The leaf-disc grafting system described here consists in replacing a disc of leaf tissue with a similar disc from an infected plant. This can be performed in young seedlings not yet big enough to endure other types of grafting. Graft success and infection rates average approximately 80%. Conclusions: We describe the successful adaptation of leaf-disc grafting as a powerful screening tool for HLB. The system requires minimal plant material and can be performed in seedlings at a very young age with increased efficiency in terms of time, space, and resources. © 2017 Tabay et al.

abstract={Dispersal is a key individual-based process influencing many life-history attributes and scaling up to population-level properties (e.g. metapopulation connectivity). A persistent challenge in dispersal ecology has been the robust characterization of dispersal functions (kernels), a fundamental tool to predict how dispersal processes respond under global change scenarios. Particularly, the rightmost tail of these functions, that is the long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, are difficult to characterize empirically and to model in realistic ways. But, when is it a LDD event? In the specific case of plants, dispersal has three basic components: (i) a distinct (sessile) source, the maternal plant producing the fruits or the paternal tree acting as a source of pollen; (ii) a distance component between source and target locations; and (iii) a vector actually performing the movement entailing the dispersal event. Here, I discuss operative definitions of LDD based on their intrinsic properties: (i) events crossing geographic boundaries among stands; and (ii) events contributing to effective gene flow and propagule migration. Strict-sense long-distance dispersal involves movement both outside the stand geographic limits and outside the genetic neighbourhood area of individuals. Combinations of propagule movements within/outside these two spatial reference frames result in four distinct modes of LDD. Synthesis. I expect truncation of seed dispersal kernels to have multiple consequences on demography and genetics, following to the loss of key dispersal services in natural populations. Irrespective of neighbourhood sizes, loss of LDD events may result in more structured and less cohesive genetic pools, with increased isolation by distance extending over broader areas. Proper characterization of the LDD events helps to assess, for example, how the ongoing defaunation of large-bodied frugivores pervasively entails the loss of crucial LDD functions. © 2016 The Author.

abstract={Dynein light chain (DLC) is one important component of the dynein complexes, which have been proved involving in a variety of cellular functions. However, higher plants lack all other components of the complexes except DLCs, suggesting that in plants, the DLC protein does not carry out the same function as it in animals. Therefore, the function of this family in plants is mysterious. In this study, we investigated the DLC gene family in 15 plant species and analyzed their expression profiles. In total, 128 DLC genes were identified from the 15 studied plant species and were divided into eight groups by their phylogenetic relation. Highly conserved gene structure and motif arrangement was discovered within each group, indicating their functional correlation. Genetic variation and recombination events were also detected in DLC genes. Through selection analyses, we also identified some significant site-specific constraints in most of the DLC paralogs. In addition, DLC genes presented various expression profiles in different development stages, or under different abiotic stresses or phytohormone treatments. This may be associated with a variety of cis-elements responding to stress and phytohormone in the upstream sequences of the DLC genes. Functional network analysis exhibited 123 physical or functional interactions. The results provide a foundation for exploring the characterization of the DLC genes in plants and offer insights for additional functional studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Self-incompatibility (SI) promotes outcrossing, but transitions to self-compatibility (SC) are frequent. Population genetic theory describing the breakdown of SI to SC suggests that, under most conditions, populations should be composed of either SI or SC individuals. Under a narrow range of conditions, theory suggests that SI may persist alongside reduced expression of SI (pseudo-SI, PSI) in mixed-mating populations. We studied genetic variation for PSI segregating in four SI populations of Leavenworthia alabamica by measurement of the heritability of pollen tube number after self-pollination. We tested for the role of the S-locus in this variation by sequencing seven S-alleles from plants with high pseudo-SC (PSC) and testing for the co-segregation of these alleles with PSC. We found a continuous distribution of PSC in all populations and 90% of plants exhibited PSC. The heritability ranged from 0.39 to 0.57. All seven S-alleles from plants with high PSC exhibited trans-specific polymorphism, and no stop codons were observed within the c. 600-bp region sequenced. One of these S-alleles was directly associated with the inheritance of PSC. We conclude that heritable variation in PSC is largely a result of genetic variation in the signaling cascade downstream of the S-locus reaction, together with the presence of one leaky S-allele. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Leaf senescence is the last phase of plant development and a highly coordinated process regulated by a large number of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). By broad literature survey, we constructed a leaf senescence database (LSD) in 2011 and updated it to Version 2.0 in 2014 (http://www.eplantsenescence. org/ and http://psd.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) which contains a total of 5357 genes and 324 mutants from 44 species. These SAGs were retrieved based on genetic, genomic, proteomic, physiological, or other experimental evidence and were classified into different categories according to their functions in leaf senescence or morphological phenotype of mutants. To provide comprehensive information for SAGs, we made extensive annotation by both manual and computational approaches. In addition, we predicted putative orthologues of the SAGs in other species. LSD has a user-friendly interface to allow users to make text queries or BLAST searches and to download SAGs sequences for local analysis. Functional analyses of putative SAGs reveal that WRKY75, AZF2, NAC16, and WRKY26 are positive regulators of leaf senescence, while MKP2 and CTR1 perform negative regulation to leaf senescence. This database has been served as a valuable resource for basic research on the function of SAGs and evolution of plant leaf senescence, as well as for the exploration of genetic traits in agronomically important plants. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={The phenomenon of genotype × environment (G × E) interaction in plant breeding decreases selection accuracy, thereby negatively affecting genetic gains. Several genomic prediction models incorporating G × E have been recently developed and used in genomic selection of plant breeding programs. Genomic prediction models for assessing multi-environment G × E interaction are extensions of a singleenvironment model, and have advantages and limitations. In this study, we propose two multi-environment Bayesian genomic models: the first model considers genetic effects (u) that can be assessed by the Kronecker product of variance-covariance matrices of genetic correlations between environments and genomic kernels through markers under two linear kernel methods, linear (genomic best linear unbiased predictors, GBLUP) and Gaussian (Gaussian kernel, GK). The other model has the same genetic component as the first model (u) plus an extra component, f, that captures random effects between environments that were not captured by the random effects u: We used five CIMMYT data sets (one maize and four wheat) that were previously used in different studies. Results show that models with G × E always have superior prediction ability than single-environment models, and the higher prediction ability of multi-environment models with u and f over the multi-environment model with only u occurred 85% of the time with GBLUP and 45% of the time with GK across the five data sets. The latter result indicated that including the random effect f is still beneficial for increasing prediction ability after adjusting by the random effect u. © 2017 Cuevas et al.},

abstract={Water chestnuts (genus Trapa) are an annual floating-leaved aquatic plants widely distributed in the Old World. The taxonomy of the genus is extremely confusing worldwide. The plants of Trapa are abundant in lakes of mid-to-lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. The genetic relationship and diversity among three common Trapa species in the area were evaluated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 249 unambiguous bands, of which 192 (77.1%) were polymorphic, was produced with four pairs of primers. The genetic relationship estimated by different approaches (NJ tree, STRCTURE, PCA and UPGMA) consistently indicated that all the three Trapa taxa formed genetically distinct groups, which confirmed the taxonomic status of the three separate species (T. quadrispinosa, T. japonica and T. bispinosa). The three Trapa taxa appeared to possess low level of gene diversity (HE = 0.073–0.107) compared with the perennial aquatic macrophytes in the same habitat and range distribution. The main factor responsible for that was the habitat deterioration of recent years combined with the annual life history of the plants. Evident genetic structure was found among populations for each Trapa taxon, contributing more than 50% of the total gene diversity. The high genetic differentiation could be due to the restricted gene flow among populations (Nm = 0.165–0.243) and the high degree of inbreeding (FIS = 0.482–0.503) in their reproductive system. These results were important in relation to conservation management of Trapa taxa. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Elephantgrass has been a notable option as bioenergy plant. However, for its bioenergetic use, the quantification of genetic diversity based on biomass quality traits has not been commonly reported in the literature. The objective of this study was to quantify the genetic diversity among 100 accessions of the Active Elephantgrass Germplasm Bank (BAGCE), by means of morphological (flowering, height, vigor and stalk diameter), agronomic (total dry biomass) and biomass quality traits (dry matter concentration, cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, in vitro digestibility, nitrogen, ash, and calorific value), and the ultimate goal was to use the elephantgrass as a bioenergy feedstock. By using mixed model methodology and genetic diversity analyses, it was found genetic variability between elephantgrass accessions, which is the basic premise to start any breeding program. The BAGCE presented greater genetic variability for the biomass quality traits, when compared with morpho-agronomic traits. The accessions were divided into 6 clusters of genetic similarity, with potential for use in second generation ethanol production and direct biomass combustion, besides forage uses. Furthermore, to potentiate elephantgrass as bioenergetic plant, crosses among divergent individuals from distinct clusters were recommended. Thus, the genetic variability of BAGCE can be exploited to produce superior combinations that can maximize second generation ethanol conversion and biomass direct combustion. In addition, these actions can increase the contribution of elephantgrass for a sustainable energetic matrix diversification. © 2016 The Authors},

Subcellular localization and transactivation assay demonstrated that OsERF109 was localized in nucleus and possessed transactivation activity. Transgenic plants overexpressing (OE) and knockdown with RNA interfering (RI) OsERF109 exhibited significantly reduced and improved drought resistance, respectively, indicating that OsERF109 negatively regulates drought resistance in rice. Furthermore, measurement by gas chromatography showed that ethylene contents were less in OE while more in RI lines than these in wild types, supporting the data of drought tolerance and water loss in transgenic lines. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also proved the regulation of OsERF109 in the expression of OSACS6, OSACO2, and OsERF3, which have been identified to play important roles in ethylene biosynthesis. Based on these results, our data evidence that OsERF109 regulates drought resistance by affecting the ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Overall, our study reveals the negative role of OsERF109 in ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Several perennial grasses have been studied as energetic feedstock due to high lignocellulosic production, making it an alternative bioenergy source. This is the first study to investigate the aptitude of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.), aiming to breed it for bioenergy production via direct combustion of biomass. The evaluation of the aptitude and the estimates of the genotypic values were carried out using the mixed models methodology. The canonical correlation analyses were carried out among morpho-agronomic and biomass quality traits for the groups Napier and Cameroon. Complementarily, it was used path analysis with calorific value as the principle variable. Elephant grass presented 22.59 Mg ha−1 mean biomass production. Cameroon group presents the greatest aptitude to be used as bioenergetic raw material via direct combustion of biomass, with 24.13 Mg ha−1 total dry biomass, and 18.16 MJ kg−1 calorific value. The ash content has high correlation and high direct effect on the calorific value. Genetic breeding for morpho-agronomic traits within the Cameroon group is recommended. The canonical correlation analyses and path analyses indicate that in the initial stages of elephant grass breeding program, there is a possibility of indirect selection via morpho-agronomic traits to obtain genetic gain in calorific value. In this sense, tandem selection within the Cameroon group could be a good option, in which the genotypes with the tallest and the thickest stalk diameter should be selected among the genotypes with the greatest dry matter content. © 2016},

abstract={Iris dichotoma and I. domestica were repeatedly crossed to obtain hybrids, a potentially new plant with high ornamental value. These hybrids are frequently selected for dwarf scaping, their large numbers of flowers, and their novel flower color; however selection is limited because of a lack of information between genotype and phenotypes. This study was aimed at characterizing the genetic differentiation of flower color among I. dichotoma, I. domestica, and four of their hybrids [F1, F2, backcrossing with I. domestica (BC1) as well as backcrossing with I. dichotoma (BC2)]. Seven phenotypic characteristics were analyzed: leaf width, leaf number, scape length, number of floral buds per stem, outer perianth length, inner perianth length, perianth color, and flower spots or veins. A high heritability estimate was obtained for scape length, which could be selected at early generations in individual plants, effectively shortening the breeding period. The correlation coefficient of outer and inner perianth lengths were high at 0.867, suggesting genetically linked traits. A high variation in flower color was found in F2s and BC1, hence novel color can be selected by repetitive self-crossing and BC1. These results are conducive to enhance the Iris breeding process and contribute to selection of individuals for lodging resistance, a large number of flowers, and novel flower color. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The national soybean production satisfies only 7.0% of the demand for poultry-swine chain, with imports in 2014 of 363501 tons of grain and 1018256 tons of soybean meal. Currently, in Colombia, soybean is only produced in the Orinoquia region, mainly in the high plains and foothills and is part of the rice-cornsoy rotation system for the colonization of native savannas. In order to promote cultivation which allows the occupation of 500000 potentially hectares in the foothills with new varieties beyond current and meet domestic demand, Corpoica is responsible for the plant breeding. As a result of a research in plant genetic resources during nine years (2006-2014), the study of a group of elite soybean genotypes on two contrasting regions: high plains and foothills. In addition, main components analysis per genotype-location interaction were determined for L-189 genotype identified with specific adaptation to the foothills and the highest experimental yield of 2660 k.ha-1, superior in more than half a ton to the yield obtained by the control varieties (P-34 and Superior 6); with traits which bring competitive advantages such as a larger number of pods per plant (56) and smaller seeds (15.2g), besides an acquired tolerance to the Cercospora sp. pathogen.},

abstract={Key message: A CIho 5791 × Tifang recombinant inbred mapping population was developed and used to identify major dominant resistance genes on barley chromosomes 6H and 3H in CI5791 and on 3H in Tifang. Abstract: The barley line CIho 5791 confers high levels of resistance to Pyrenophora teres f. teres, causal agent of net form net blotch (NFNB), with few documented isolates overcoming this resistance. Tifang barley also harbors resistance to P. teres f. teres which was previously shown to localize to barley chromosome 3H. A CIho 5791 × Tifang F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed using single seed descent. The Illumina iSelect SNP platform was used to identify 2562 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the barley genome, resulting in seven linkage maps, one for each barley chromosome. The CIho 5791 × Tifang RIL population was evaluated for NFNB resistance using nine P. teres f. teres isolates collected globally. Tifang was resistant to four of the isolates tested whereas CIho 5791 was highly resistant to all nine isolates. QTL analysis indicated that the CIho 5791 resistance mapped to chromosome 6H whereas the Tifang resistance mapped to chromosome 3H. Additionally, CIho 5791 also harbored resistance to two Japanese isolates that mapped to a 3H region similar to that of Tifang. SNP markers and RILs harboring both 3H and 6H resistance will be useful in resistance breeding against NFNB. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract={Crop genotypes that make best use of potassium (K) fertilizers can promote agricultural sustainability. However, screening germplasm collections for responses to K fertilizers is often laborious and expensive. To reduce costs, the number of K fertilizer treatments required to identify better genotypes should be minimized. This might be achieved by exploiting the mathematical relationships between biomass, plant K content, and K supply. This study employed 14 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes growing in a hydroponics system that allowed the K supply to roots to be controlled through the K concentration in a flowing solution. It sought to determine the minimal number of treatments required to model the relationships between (a) shoot biomass and K supply, (b) plant K content and K supply, and (c) shoot biomass and plant K content. The relationships between (a) shoot biomass and K supply and (b) plant K content and K supply for any given genotype could be fitted by Michaelis–Menten equations and each of these could be estimated from data obtained at two, appropriately-chosen, rates of K supply. The relationship between shoot biomass and plant K content could be estimated from these relationships. However, the optimum K supply required for accurate estimates differed between genotypes and whether shoot biomass or plant K content was to be estimated. It is, therefore, suggested that the relationships between shoot biomass, plant K content, and K supply might best be determined from measurements of biomass and K content at three, carefully-selected, rates of K supply. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Key message: Genome-wide association mapping of resistance against the novel, aggressive ‘Warrior’ race of yellow rust in triticale revealed a genetic architecture with some medium-effect QTL and a quantitative component, which in combination confer high levels of resistance on both leaves and ears.Abstract: Yellow rust is an important destructive fungal disease in small grain cereals and the exotic ‘Warrior’ race has recently conquered Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic architecture of yellow rust resistance in hexaploid winter triticale as the basis for a successful resistance breeding. To this end, a diverse panel of 919 genotypes was evaluated for yellow rust infection on leaves and ears in multi-location field trials and genotyped by genotyping-by-sequencing as well as for known Yr resistance loci. Genome-wide association mapping identified ten quantitative trait loci (QTL) for yellow rust resistance on the leaves and seven of these also for ear resistance. The total genotypic variance explained by the QTL amounted to 44.0% for leaf and 26.0% for ear resistance. The same three medium-effect QTL were identified for both traits on chromosomes 1B, 2B, and 7B. Interestingly, plants pyramiding the resistance allele of all three medium-effect QTL were generally most resistant, but constitute less than 5% of the investigated triticale breeding material. Nevertheless, a genome-wide prediction yielded a higher predictive ability than prediction based on these three QTL. Taken together, our results show that yellow rust resistance in winter triticale is genetically complex, including both medium-effect QTL as well as a quantitative resistance component. Resistance to the novel ‘Warrior’ race of this fungal pathogen is consequently best achieved by recurrent selection in the field based on identified resistant lines and can potentially be assisted by genomic approaches. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract={The dwarfing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding has promoted a dramatic increase in yields. Since the utilized dwarfing genes in wheat are very limited, identification of novel dwarfing genes is necessary for improving the genetic diversity of wheat. In this study, more than 300 dwarfing wheat lines from induced mutation were screened by kompetitive allele-specific PCR and gibberellin (GA) treatment. The 17.49% of Rht-D1b and 1.37% of Rht-B1b dwarfing mutants were identified in this mutant group. Additionally, Rht-D1b mutants showed more effective in reduction of plant height and higher 1000-grain weight comparing with that of Rht-B1b mutants. By combing with comparison of yield components and expression profile of GA biosynthetic genes with wild-type, the GA-responsive mutant dm15 without directly involvement in GA metabolism, significantly increased 1000-grain weight but no change of other yield components in two locations of field experiments. Meanwhile, another elite mutant dm11 with change of GA biosynthetic genes expression was also identified. These mutants will be promising candidates for dwarfing wheat breeding.

abstract={Although somatic embryogenesis (SE), a multi-step process starting from somatic tissues and ending with somatic embryos, has been applied to numerous plants including Medicago sp., the molecular basis of development reprograming in somatic cells toward the embryogenic pathway is still incompletely known. Though recent analysis of the proteome and transcriptome has led to the identification and characterization of new genes involved in SE, lot of these genes are up-regulated only in the late developmental stages. Consequently, this work was aimed at finding out if and when the genetic program changed during the SE induction phase in both the highly embryogenic line M9-10a of Medicago truncatula cv. Jemalong and its non-embryogenic predecessor line, M9. Based on multipoint (day 0, 2, 7, 14 and 21) gene expression qPCR analysis of two embryogenesis marker genes LEC1 and L1L and selected genes encoding proteins of PRC2 complex (CLF, SWN, FIE, MSI1, VRN2) it was possible to distinguish two periods during the induction phase. The first week was related to dedifferentiation with no visible changes in explant morphology and lack of transcripts of LEC1 and L1L; the expression of PRC2 members, however, increased in the embryogenic line. The next two weeks were regarded as the expression phase involving the beginning of a rapid callus growth and the appearance of products for LEC genes, which was observed in the embryogenic line only. However, the callus formation was observed in the non-embryogenic line as well, but the LEC1 and L1L genes were not expressed and the transcription of PRC2 genes was at stable level. It was only the SWN expression that decreased at the beginning of induction and did not change in the subsequent days in both lines. Our results indicate that LEC1 and L1L, known as marker genes of the late developmental stages, may be associated with the acquisition of embryogenic competency by somatic cells (prime events in the SE induction). The PRC2 complex genes are also expressed during embryogenic callus tissue formation on Medicago tuncatula leaf explants. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={Aims: In this work, an ammonium-excreting strain (HM053) of A. brasilense was further characterized genetically and biochemically, and its abilities to colonize and promote wheat growth were determined. Methods: Immunoblot, reverse transcription-qPCR, and DNA sequencing were used for HM053 characterization. To analyze wheat-A. brasilense interaction nifH::gusA fusions in the wild-type FP2 (FP2-7) and HM053 (HM053-36) backgrounds were employed. Results: HM053 glutamine synthetase (GS) was not adenylylated in response to an ammonium shock or under any condition tested. Sequencing of the glnA gene revealed a substitution of a proline residue by a leucine at position 347 of the GS. Under axenic growth condition, HM053 was capable of colonizing the surface of wheat roots and increased by 30 and 49% the shoot and root dry weight, respectively, when compared with uninoculated plants, and by 30 and 31% when compared with the parental strain FP2. Although HM053-36 and FP2-7 showed GUS activity located mainly at lateral root emergence points, HM053-36 consistently showed stronger signals and expressed the nifH gene at a level 278 fold higher than strain FP2 in planta, according to qPCR data. Conclusions: HM053, a spontaneous mutant in GS, increased wheat root and shoot dry weight when compared to the wild-type FP2. HM053 ability to excrete ammonium and fix nitrogen constitutively, even in the presence of high NH4 + concentration, could explain why this mutant has a higher potential to promote plant growth than FP2 and suggests HM053 as a potential nitrogen biofertilizer. However, HM053 should be tested under field conditions to evaluate its abilities to compete with indigenous microflora. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland},

abstract={Sugarcane suffers from various abiotic stresses due to periodic weather changes during long cropping cycle in subtropics, leading to reduction in total yield. DREB1A gene encodes a member of the DREB subfamily of ERF/AP2 transcription factor and is induced in response to various abiotic stresses in plants. Overexpression of DREB in cereals has been associated with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance. In order to generate abiotic stress-tolerant sugarcane, we used synthetic DREB gene construct under the control of stress-inducible RD29 promoter and generated transgenic plants. Genetic transformation of 675 calli using particle gene gun followed by selection on paromomycin resulted into recovery of 55 (~9%) putative transgenic calli. Thirty-five plants were regenerated from paromomycin selected calli. PCR analysis of 35 putative transgenic plants with transgene-specific primer pair gave us 6 plants with the RD29A/DREB gene cassette. Six transgenic plants were vegetatively propagated and subjected to abiotic stresses, i.e. drought, salt, 24-h cold and 5D cold. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR analysis for DREB transcript from stressed and control transgenic plants showed DREB transcript induction to 6–18-fold in different abiotic stresses, showing stress-inducible nature of the gene cassette. © 2016 Society for Sugar Research &#38; Promotion},

abstract={To identify novel allelic variations in key genes of wheat quality, the present study used the targeting induced local lesions in genomes platform to detect point mutations in target genes. The wheat variety Longfumai 17 was treated by the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate to produce a bulk M2 generation, and the population included 1122 plants. A total length of 3906.80 kb nucleotides was analyzed, and the average mutation density was 1/244.17 kb. The identified mutations included G&gt;A substitutions (43.75%), C&gt;T substitutions (31.25%), A insertions (12.50%), T insertions (6.25%), and deletions (6.25%). These point mutations led to changes in amino acids and thus the encoded protein sequences, ultimately producing 18.75% of missense mutations, 12.50% of frame shift mutations, 6.25% of nonsense mutations, 25.00% of silent mutations and 37.50% of non-coding region mutations. In the kernel hardness gene Pinb and 3 starch synthesis genes waxy, Agp2 and SSIIa-A, we detected 16 different point mutations in 25 mutant lines. The Pinb gene harbored two missense mutations and a nonsense mutation; the C&gt;T missense mutation resulted in a novel allele, this novel allele and the nonsense mutation alerted protein 3D structure; the waxy gene presented missense and frame shift mutations; the Agp2 gene carried a missense mutation; the SSIIa-A incurred a missense mutation and a frame shift mutation that resulted in premature protein termination. All the frame shift mutations, nonsense mutations and the Pinb novel allele resulted in allelic variation of their corresponding genes, which in turn affected their gene functions. The identified mutant lines can be used as intermediate materials in wheat quality improvement schemes. © 2016 The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer-Science and Media},

abstract={Biotechnological applications of microbial pectate lyases (Pels) in plant fiber processing are promising, eco-friendly substitutes for conventional chemical degumming processes. However, to potentiate the enzymes’ use for industrial applications, resolving the molecular structure to elucidate catalytic mechanisms becomes necessary. In this manuscript, we report the high resolution (1.45 Å) crystal structure of pectate lyase (pelN) from Paenibacillus sp. 0602 in apo form. Through sequence alignment and structural superposition with other members of the polysaccharide lyase (PL) family 1 (PL1), we determined that pelN shares the characteristic right-handed β-helix and is structurally similar to other members of the PL1 family, while exhibiting key differences in terms of catalytic and substrate binding residues. Then, based on information from structure alignments with other PLs, we engineered a novel pelN. Our rational design yielded a pelN mutant with a temperature for enzymatic activity optimally shifted from 67.5 to 60 °C. Most importantly, this pelN mutant displayed both higher specific activity and ramie fiber degumming ability when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Altogether, our rational design method shows great potential for industrial applications. Moreover, we expect the reported high-resolution crystal structure to provide a solid foundation for future rational, structure-based engineering of genetically enhanced pelNs. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract={Background: Soybean (Glycine max L.) is an agronomic crop belonging to the legume family, and is the top second plant species with the highest iron (Fe) content. When exposed to Fe-deficiency during growth in the field, soybean yields are negatively affected from impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis, which is called as Fe-deficiency chlorosis (IDC). Although IDC in soybeans has been observed for years, the molecular studies to develop IDC-tolerant soybean cultivars were slower compared to the studies of other plant species. Scope: Recently, there are efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms behind IDC tolerance and use them to develop IDC-tolerant soybeans via molecular breeding and transgenic approaches. Genetic transformation of soybean is relatively easy, and loss-of-function mutant collections are readily available. There is a divergence in IDC tolerance among soybean cultivars, suggesting a potential improvement of soybean tolerance to IDC via molecular breeding. This mini review covers the latest developments in the field of soybean research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IDC tolerance. Conclusion: Soybean should be used a new model plant in understanding the Fe-deficiency tolerance mechanisms especially because of its high potential to be used as a bio-fortified crop to treat the iron deficiency in humans in the future. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland},

abstract={Independent gametophyte ferns are unique among vascular plants because they are sporophyteless and reproduce asexually to maintain their populations in the gametophyte generation. Such ferns had been primarily discovered in temperate zone, and usually hypothesized with (sub)tropical origins and subsequent extinction of sporophyte due to climate change during glaciations. Presumably, independent fern gametophytes are unlikely to be distributed in tropics and subtropics because of relatively stable climates which are less affected by glaciations. Nonetheless, the current study presents cases of two independent gametophyte fern species in subtropic East Asia. In this study, we applied plastid DNA sequences (trnL-L-F and matK + ndhF + chlL datasets) and comprehensive sampling (~80%) of congeneric species for molecular identification and divergence time estimation of these independent fern gametophytes. The two independent gametophyte ferns were found belonging to genus Haplopteris (vittarioids, Pteridaceae) and no genetic identical sporophyte species in East Asia. For one species, divergence times between its populations imply recent oversea dispersal(s) by spores occurred during Pleistocene. By examining their ex situ and in situ fertility, prezygotic sterility was found in these two Haplopteris, in which gametangia were not or very seldom observed, and this prezygotic sterility might attribute to their lacks of functional sporophytes. Our field observation and survey on their habitats suggest microhabitat conditions might attribute to this prezygotic sterility. These findings point to consideration of whether recent climate change during the Pleistocene glaciation resulted in ecophysiological maladaptation of non-temperate independent gametophyte ferns. In addition, we provided a new definition to classify fern gametophyte independences at the population level. We expect that continued investigations into tropical and subtropical fern gametophyte floras will further illustrate the biogeographic significance of non-temperate fern gametophyte independence. © 2016 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan},

abstract={Background: Gene copy number divergence between species is a form of genetic polymorphism that contributes significantly to both genome size and phenotypic variation. In plants, copy number expansions of single genes were implicated in cultivar- or species-specific tolerance of high levels of soil boron, aluminium or calamine-type heavy metals, respectively. Arabidopsis halleri is a zinc- and cadmium-hyperaccumulating extremophile species capable of growing on heavy-metal contaminated, toxic soils. In contrast, its non-accumulating sister species A. lyrata and the closely related reference model species A. thaliana exhibit merely basal metal tolerance. Results: For a genome-wide assessment of the role of copy number divergence (CND) in lineage-specific environmental adaptation, we conducted cross-species array comparative genome hybridizations of three plant species and developed a global signal scaling procedure to adjust for sequence divergence. In A. halleri, transition metal homeostasis functions are enriched twofold among the genes detected as copy number expanded. Moreover, biotic stress functions including mostly disease Resistance (R) gene-related genes are enriched twofold among genes detected as copy number reduced, when compared to the abundance of these functions among all genes. Conclusions: Our results provide genome-wide support for a link between evolutionary adaptation and CND in A. halleri as shown previously for Heavy metal ATPase4. Moreover our results support the hypothesis that elemental defences, which result from the hyperaccumulation of toxic metals, allow the reduction of classical defences against biotic stress as a trade-off. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) has been instrumental to recent advances in our understanding of the molecular function of the plant immune system. However, this work has not yet included plant associated and phytopathogenic yeasts largely due to a lack of yeast species known to interact with arabidopsis. The plant phylloplane is a significant habitat for neutral-residents, plant-growth and health-promoting species, and latent-pathogenic species. However, yeast phylloplane residents of arabidopsis remain underexplored. To address this, resident yeasts from the phyllosphere of wild arabidopsis collected in field conditions have been isolated and characterized. A total of 95 yeast strains representing 23 species in 9 genera were discovered, including potentially psychrophilic and pathogenic strains. Physiological characterization revealed thermotolerance profiles, sensitivity to the arabidopsis phytoalexin camalexin, the production of indolic compounds, and the ability to activate auxin responses in planta. These results indicate a rich diversity of yeasts present in the arabidopsis phylloplane and have created culture resources and information useful in the development of model systems for arabidopsis-yeast interactions. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Key message: Species ofAesculusgenus are divided into five main sections according to their susceptibility and resistance to horse chestnut leaf miner using molecular markers.Abstract: Some species of the genus Aesculus are yearly severely infested by horse chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella). The larvae mine the leaves and under appropriate conditions can damage up to 100% of the leaf area. In this study, we assessed the genetic diversity of eight species of horse chestnut and their genotypes which have varying susceptibility to the leaf miner. Analysis of eight microsatellite loci showed high polymorphic information content 0.45–0.77 (0.60 in average) and high genetic diversity. For each locus, we found on average 5.50 alleles. During three vegetation periods, the leaf area damage of these genotypes was evaluated using the statistical software Assess 2.0. Different pressure of leaf miner and different development at each locality was recorded, and in some cases less damage was found, in one case the lesser damage was permanent. From the data, a pathological scale was established and a dendogram of similarity was created. Based on SSR analysis, four groups of Aesculus trees were distinguished according to their resistance or susceptibility and five main section+Hybrid were found. By cloning and analysing the inner transcribed spacers, the ITS1 and ITS2, inner and inter species variability was examined. For the sequence of hybrid species A. × carnea, no compliance was revealed in NBCI database. For this reason, the first sequence of this genotype was obtained. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross of Bairds with susceptible parent Atred#1 was phenotyped for leaf rust response at Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 under artificially created epidemics of Puccinia triticina (Pt) race BBG/BP. The RIL population and its parents were genotyped with the 50 K diversity arrays technology (DArT) sequence system and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A genetic map comprising 1150 markers was used to map the resistance loci. Four significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on chromosomes 1BL, 2BC (centromere region), 5BL and 6BL. These QTLs, named Lr46, QLr.cim-2BC, QLr.cim-5BL and QLr.cim-6BL, respectively, explained 13.5–60.8%, 9.0–14.3%, 2.8–13.9%, and 11.6–29.4%, respectively, of leaf rust severity variation by the inclusive composite interval mapping method. All of these resistance loci were contributed by the resistant parent Bairds, except for QLr.cim-2BC, which came from susceptible parent Atred#1. Among these, the QTL on chromosome 1BL was the known pleiotropic APR gene Lr46, whereas QLr.cim-6BL, a consistently detected locus, should be a new leaf rust resistance locus in durum wheat. The mean leaf rust severity of RILs carrying all four QTLs ranged from 8.0 to 17.5%, whereas it ranged from 10.9 to 38.5% for three QTLs (Lr46 + 5BL + 6BL) derived from the resistant parent Bairds. Two RILs with four QTLs combinations can be used as sources of complex APR in durum wheat breeding. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract={The huge variation in root system architecture (RSA) among different rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars is conferred by their genetic makeup and different growth or climatic conditions. Unlike model plant Arabidopsis, the molecular basis of such variation in RSA is very poorly understood in rice. Cultivars with stable variation are valuable resources for identification of genes involved in RSA and related physiological traits. We have screened for RSA and identified two such indica rice cultivars, IR-64 (OsAS83) and IET-16348 (OsAS84), with stable contrasting RSA. OsAS84 produces robust RSA with more crown roots, lateral roots and root hairs than OsAS83. Using comparative root transcriptome analysis of these cultivars, we identified genes related to root development and different physiological responses like abiotic stress responses, hormone signaling, and nutrient acquisition or transport. The two cultivars differ in their response to salinity/dehydration stresses, phosphate/nitrogen deficiency, and different phytohormones. Differential expression of genes involved in salinity or dehydration response, nitrogen (N) transport, phosphate (Pi) starvation signaling, hormone signaling and root development underlies more resistance of OsAS84 towards abiotic stresses, Pi or N deficiency and its robust RSA. Thus our study uncovers gene-network involved in root development and abiotic stress responses in rice. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Aquaporins (AQPs) are channel-forming integral membrane proteins that facilitate the movement of water and many other small molecules. Compared to animals, plants contain a much higher number of AQPs in their genome. Homology-based identification of AQPs in sequenced species is feasible because of the high level of conservation of protein sequences across plant species. Genome-wide characterization of AQPs has highlighted several important aspects such as distribution, genetic organization, evolution and conserved features governing solute specificity. From a functional point of view, the understanding of AQP transport system has expanded rapidly with the help of transcriptomics and proteomics data. The efficient analysis of enormous amounts of data generated through omic scale studies has been facilitated through computational advancements. Prediction of protein tertiary structures, pore architecture, cavities, phosphorylation sites, heterodimerization, and co-expression networks has become more sophisticated and accurate with increasing computational tools and pipelines. However, the effectiveness of computational approaches is based on the understanding of physiological and biochemical properties, transport kinetics, solute specificity, molecular interactions, sequence variations, phylogeny and evolution of aquaporins. For this purpose, tools like Xenopus oocyte assays, yeast expression systems, artificial proteoliposomes, and lipid membranes have been efficiently exploited to study the many facets that influence solute transport by AQPs. In the present review, we discuss genome-wide identification of AQPs in plants in relation with recent advancements in analytical tools, and their availability and technological challenges as they apply to AQPs. An exhaustive reviewof omics resources available for AQP research is also provided in order to optimize their efficient utilization. Finally, a detailed catalog of computational tools and analytical pipelines is offered as a resource for AQP research. © 2016 Deshmukh, Sonah and Bélanger.},

abstract={Global climate change (GCC) can negatively affect freshwater ecosystems. However, the degree to which freshwater populations can acclimate to long-term warming and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We used the cooling water discharge (CWD) area of a power plant as a model for long-term warming. Survival and molecular stress responses (expression of molecular chaperones, antioxidants, bioenergetic and protein synthesis biomarkers) to experimental warming (20-41 °C, +1.5 °C per day) were assessed in invasive clams Corbicula fluminea from two pristine populations and a CWD population. CWD clams had considerably higher (by ∼8-12 °C) lethal temperature thresholds than clams from the pristine areas. High thermal tolerance of CWD clams was associated with overexpression of heat shock proteins HSP70, HSP90 and HSP60 and activation of protein synthesis at 38 °C. Heat shock response was prioritized over the oxidative stress response resulting in accumulation of oxidative lesions and ubiquitinated proteins during heat stress in CWD clams. Future studies should determine whether the increase in thermal tolerance in CWD clams are due to genetic adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity. Overall, our findings indicate that C. fluminea has potential to survive and increase its invasive range during warming such as expected during GCC. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Rose-scented geranium is an important aromatic herb, have eminent for oil. The oil of geranium commercially utilized in the perfumery, cosmetic and aromatherapy industries all over the world. It is also helpful to cure many of the diseases, since it possess antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. However rose scented geranium suffer from several biotic and abiotic stresses, which reduced the yield of oil. So there is need to genetically improve the geranium using biotechnological approaches. The present study demonstrates the establishment of direct regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404) mediated transformation protocol in Pelargonium graveolens (cv. CIM-BIO 171). Different media combinations such as benzyl amino purine (BAP), kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), and adenine di-sulphate (ADS) were standardised to induce direct regeneration in P. graveolens. The maximum regeneration frequency i.e. 90.56 ± 1.2% per explant was achieved from petiolar segments in medium containing 2.5 mg/l BAP, 0.1 mg/l NAA, 1 mg/l ADS. However, with the leaf explants only 45.94 ± 2.91% frequency was achieved. In the present study, A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 was used carrying binary vector pBI121 with the gusA as a reporter gene and neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) gene as a plant selectable marker. Parameters like bacterial optical density, infection time, acetosyringone concentration and kanamycin concentration were optimised to achieve maximum transformation frequency (69.5 ± 2.3%).The putative transgenic shoots were subsequently rooted on half strength MS medium and successfully transferred to the greenhouse. The transgenic plants were characterised by gus histochemical assay, PCR analysis (nptII-786 bp and gus A- 1707 bp) and Southern hybridization tests using gusA gene probe. The regeneration as well as transformation protocol will no doubt provide the basis to decipher the insights of metabolic pathways in geranium. Also could be useful for genetic improvement, to make it more tolerant/resistant against biotic and abiotic stresses and ultimately fruitful for Indian farmers in agronomic traits like high biomass, oil content, yield and better quality. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract={Nitrogen fixation-the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) gas to biologically available nitrogen (N)-is an important source of N for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In terrestrial environments, N2-fixing symbioses involve multicellular plants, but in the marine environment these symbioses occur with unicellular planktonic algae. An unusual symbiosis between an uncultivated unicellular cyanobacterium (UCYN-A) and a haptophyte picoplankton alga was recently discovered in oligotrophic oceans. UCYN-A has a highly reduced genome, and exchanges fixed N for fixed carbon with its host. This symbiosis bears some resemblance to symbioses found in freshwater ecosystems. UCYN-A shares many core genes with the 'spheroid bodies' of Epithemia turgida and the endosymbionts of the amoeba Paulinella chromatophora. UCYN-A is widely distributed, and has diversified into a number of sublineages that could be ecotypes. Many questions remain regarding the physical and genetic mechanisms of the association, but UCYN-A is an intriguing model for contemplating the evolution of N2-fixing organelles. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={Specification of floral organ identity is critical for the establishment of floral morphology and inflorescence architecture. Although multiple genes are involved in the regulation of floral organogenesis, our understanding of the underlying regulating network is still fragmentary. MADs-box genes are principle members in the ABCDE model that characterized floral organs. OsMADS1 specifies the determinacy of spikelet meristem and lemma/palea identity in rice. However, the pathway through which OsMADS1 regulates floral organs remains elusive; here, we identified the microRNA172 (miR172) family as possible regulators downstream of OsMADS1. Genetic study revealed that overexpression of each miR172 gene resulted in elongated lemma/palea and indeterminacy of the floret, which resemble the phenotype of osmads1 mutant. On the contrary, overexpression of each target APETALA2 (AP2) genes resulted in shortened palea/lemma. Expression level and specificity of miR172 was greatly influenced by OsMADS1, as revealed by Northern blot analysis and In situ hybridization. Genetically, AP2-3 and AP2-2 over expression rescued the elongation and inconsistent development of the lemma/palea in OsMADS1RNAi transgenic plants. Our results suggested that in rice, OsMADS1 and miR172s/AP2s formed a regulatory network involved in floral organ development, particularly the elongation of the lemma and the palea. © 2016 Dai, Wang, Zhu, Miao and Shi.},

abstract={Key message: Transcripts related to abiotic stress, oxidation, and wounding were differentially expressed inArabidopsisshoot tips in response to cryoprotectant and liquid nitrogen treatment.Abstract: Cryopreservation methods have been implemented in genebanks as a strategy to back-up plant genetic resource collections that are vegetatively propagated. Cryopreservation is frequently performed using vitrification methods, whereby shoot tips are treated with cryoprotectant solutions, such as Plant Vitrification Solution 2 (PVS2) or Plant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3); these solutions remove and/or replace freezable water within the meristem cells. We used the model system Arabidopsis thaliana to identify suites of transcripts that are up- or downregulated in response to PVS2 and PVS3 treatment and liquid nitrogen (LN) exposure. Our results suggest that there are many changes in transcript expression in shoot tips as a result of cryoprotection and that these changes exceed the number detected as a result of LN exposure. In total, 180 transcripts showed significant changes in expression level unique to treatment with either the cryoprotectant or cryopreservation followed by recovery. Of these 180 transcripts, 67 were related to stress, defense, wounding, lipid, carbohydrate, abscisic acid, oxidation, temperature (cold/heat), or osmoregulation. The responses of five transcripts were confirmed using qPCR methods. The transcripts responding to PVS2 + LN suggest an oxidative response to this treatment, whereas the PVS3 + LN treatment invoked a more general metabolic response. This work shows that the choice of cryoprotectant can have a major influence on the patterns of transcript expression, presumably due to the level and extent of stress experienced by the shoot tip. As a result, there may be divergent responses of study systems to PVS2 and PVS3 treatments. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA)},

abstract={A number of hormones work together to control plant cell growth. Rapid Alkalinization Factor 1 (RALF1), a plant-derived small regulatory peptide, inhibits cell elongation through suppression of rhizosphere acidification in plants. Although a receptor-like kinase, FERONIA (FER), has been shown to act as a receptor for RALF1, the signaling mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we identified a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RPM1-induced protein kinase, RIPK), a plasma membrane-associated member of the RLCK-VII subfamily, that is recruited to the receptor complex through interacting with FER in response to RALF1. RALF1 triggers the phosphorylation of both FER and RIPK in a mutually dependent manner. Genetic analysis of the fer-4 and ripk mutants reveals RIPK, as well as FER, to be required for RALF1 response in roots. The RALF1-FER-RIPK interactions may thus represent a mechanism for peptide signaling in plants. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The combined availability of whole genome sequences and genome editing tools is set to revolutionize the field of fruit biotechnology by enabling the introduction of targeted genetic changes with unprecedented control and accuracy, both to explore emergent phenotypes and to introduce new functionalities. Although plasmid-mediated delivery of genome editing components to plant cells is very efficient, it also presents some drawbacks, such as possible random integration of plasmid sequences in the host genome. Additionally, it may well be intercepted by current process-based GMO regulations, complicating the path to commercialization of improved varieties. Here, we explore direct delivery of purified CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to the protoplast of grape cultivar Chardonnay and apple cultivar such as Golden delicious fruit crop plants for efficient targeted mutagenesis. We targeted MLO-7, a susceptible gene in order to increase resistance to powdery mildew in grape cultivar and DIPM-1, DIPM-2, and DIPM-4 in the apple to increase resistance to fire blight disease. Furthermore, efficient protoplast transformation, the molar ratio of Cas9 and sgRNAs were optimized for each grape and apple cultivar. The targeted mutagenesis insertion and deletion rate was analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. Our results demonstrate that direct delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs to the protoplast system enables targeted gene editing and paves the way to the generation of DNA-free genome edited grapevine and apple plants. © 2016 Malnoy, Viola, Jung, Koo, Kim, Kim, Velasco and Nagamangala Kanchiswamy.},

abstract={Agro-climatic conditions of North-East India are very complex and rice cultivars present in the region have been adapted to grow under harsh environmental conditions. Germplasm present in the region is considered to possess several important and unique traits that are of importance in rice improvement programs. Genetic engineering is a powerful tool to introduce new traits into crop plants. However, not much information is available on the methods to introduce foreign genes into North-East rice cultivars. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop transformation procedures for fast recovery of transgenic plants from North-East rice cultivars. To achieve this objective, a systematic study was carried out to identify media components and culture conditions for efficient embryogenic callus induction from the mature seeds and differentiation of callus into plantlets from two North-East deep water rice cultivars, Taothabi and Khongan. Also, role of preculture of callus on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was studied. Co-cultivation of Agrobacterium with 1–5 days precultured callus was found to result in high frequency of transformation. Detailed characterization of transgenic lines confirmed stable integration of transgenes and expression of reporter gfp gene. The whole process starting from callus induction to regenerating of transgenic rice plants that can be established in the soil was achieved in about 35–45 days. The procedures developed were found to be applicable to a popular variety IR 64. Therefore, methods developed in this study should be useful not only to introduce new traits quickly but also to validate the function(s) of several candidate gene(s) identified under the functional genomics of rice. © 2016 Prof. H.S.

abstract={The enormous species richness of flowering plants is at least partly due to floral diversification driven by interactions between plants and their animal pollinators [1, 2]. Specific pollinator attraction relies on visual and olfactory floral cues [3–5]; floral scent can not only attract pollinators but also attract or repel herbivorous insects [6–8]. However, despite its central role for plant-animal interactions, the genetic control of floral scent production and its evolutionary modification remain incompletely understood [9–13]. Benzenoids are an important class of floral scent compounds that are generated from phenylalanine via several enzymatic pathways [14–17]. Here we address the genetic basis of the loss of floral scent associated with the transition from outbreeding to selfing in the genus Capsella. While the outbreeding C. grandiflora emits benzaldehyde as a major constituent of its floral scent, this has been lost in the selfing C. rubella. We identify the Capsella CNL1 gene encoding cinnamate:CoA ligase as responsible for this variation. Population genetic analysis indicates that CNL1 has been inactivated twice independently in C. rubella via different novel mutations to its coding sequence. Together with a recent study in Petunia [18], this identifies cinnamate:CoA ligase as an evolutionary hotspot for mutations causing the loss of benzenoid scent compounds in association with a shift in the reproductive strategy of Capsella from pollination by insects to self-fertilization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The interactions of plants with their pollinators are thought to be a driving force in the evolution of angiosperms. Adaptation to a new pollinator involves coordinated changes in multiple floral traits controlled by multiple genes. Surprisingly, such complex genetic shifts have happened numerous times during evolution. Here we report on the genetic basis of the changes in one such trait, floral scent emission, in the genus Petunia (Solanaceae). The increase in the quantity and complexity of the volatiles during the shift from bee to hawkmoth pollination was due to de novo expression of the genes encoding benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BSMT) and benzoyl-CoA:benzylalcohol/2-phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (BPBT) together with moderately increased transcript levels for most enzymes of the phenylpropanoid/benzenoid pathway. Loss of cinnamate-CoA ligase (CNL) function as well as a reduction in the expression of the MYB transcription factor ODO1 explain the loss of scent during the transition from moth to hummingbird pollination. The CNL gene in the hummingbird-adapted species is inactive due to a stop codon, but also appears to have undergone further degradation over time. Therefore, we propose that loss of scent happened relatively early in the transition toward hummingbird pollination, and probably preceded the loss of UV-absorbing flavonols. The discovery that CNL is also involved in the loss of scent during the transition from outcrossing to selfing in Capsella (Brassicaceae) (see the accompanying paper) raises interesting questions about the possible causes of deep evolutionary conservation of the targets of evolutionary change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},
