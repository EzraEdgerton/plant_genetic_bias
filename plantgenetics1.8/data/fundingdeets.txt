IDEAS:

Search text for nationality as well (won't do much)

If there is no funding text:
	follow url to maybe get funding text
	load that as funding text then move to next step

Google Maps each value:
	split string by ';'
		split that string by ','
			use the longest of that search as search term
			google maps search term
			get long and lat (geolocation)
			use google to get country
