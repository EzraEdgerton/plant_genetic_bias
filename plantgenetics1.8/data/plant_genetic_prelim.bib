Abstract = {{A carbohydrate esterase called glucuronoyl esterase (GE) was discovered
   10 years ago in a cellulolytic system of the wood-rotting fungus
   Schizophyllum commune. Genes coding for GEs were subsequently found in a
   number of microbial genomes, and a new family of carbohydrate esterases
   (CE15) has been established. The multidomain structures of GEs, together
   with their catalytic properties on artificial substrates and positive
   effect on enzymatic saccharification of plant biomass, led to the view
   that the esterases evolved for hydrolysis of the ester linkages between
   4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of plant glucuronoxylans and lignin
   alcohols, one of the crosslinks in the plant cell walls. This idea of
   the function of GEs is further supported by the effects of cloning of
   fungal GEs in plants and by very recently reported evidence for changes
   in the size of isolated lignin-carbohydrate complexes due to uronic acid
   de-esterification. These facts make GEs interesting candidates for
   biotechnological applications in plant biomass processing and genetic
   modification of plants. This article is a brief summary of current
   knowledge of these relatively recent and unexplored esterases.}},

Title = {{Breeding for postharvest performance in chrysanthemum by selection
   against storage-induced degreening of disk florets}},
Journal = {{POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{45-53}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Breeding for postharvest performance in ornamentals is challenging,
   since many different deteriorative processes determine vase life. In
   order to improve postharvest performance by breeding, selection should
   take place on these processes separately. To define processes that are
   important for chrysanthemum postharvest performance, vase life was
   assessed after two weeks of cold storage in a set of 44 chrysanthemum
   cultivars. Since disk floret degreening was the most frequent reason for
   ending vase life, we further investigated this trait in a large
   biparental population (n = 381). To quantify disk floret degreening in
   this large number of genotypes, we developed a high-throughput
   phenotyping method. The method consists of the quantification of loss of
   green color as expressed by an increase of intensity of red divided by
   the intensity of green (R/G) in dark-held detached capitula. R/G
   increases when disk florets lose green color. The increase in R/G
   correlated significantly with the number of days until disk floret
   degreening occurred during vase life. This was the case for the
   44-cultivar cultivar panel (Pearson's correlation coefficient (rho) of -
   0.70; p < 0.0001) as well as in a subset of the biparental pulation (n =
   145; rho = -0.67; p < 0.0001). R/G increase segregated in a quantitative
   manner in the full biparental population, and had a moderately high
   heritability of 0.73. Carbohydrate content after harvest was measured in
   a smaller subset of the biparental population (n = 55). The R/G increase
   correlated with carbohydrate content (rho=-0.56; p < 0.0001). Since
   carbohydrate content did not explain all variation in degreening
   sensitivity, we discuss different possible mechanisms to cope with
   carbohydrate starvation and avoid degreening. In conclusion, disk floret
   degreening is an important postharvest trait in chrysanthemum, and it is
   related to carbohydrate starvation. The quantitative segregation
   suggests involvement of multiple alleles, probably at multiple loci. The
   moderately high heritability makes it a suitable trait for QTL mapping,
   which we will commence in the near future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The performance of the Nano-magnetite Fe3O4 impregnated onto walnut
   shell (Fe3O4-WNS), which possessed the adsorption features of walnut
   shell and the magnetic property of Fe3O4, was investigated for the
   elimination of the methyl violet and Rhodamine 6G from contaminated
   aqueous solutions. The effects of different experimental variables on
   the removal efficiency of the cited dyes were examined. Then these
   variables were used as the inputs to generate linear and non-linear
   models such as the multiple linear regression, random forest, and
   artificial neural network to predict the removal efficiency of these dye
   species at different experimental conditions. The validation studies of
   these models were performed using the test set, which was not present in
   the modeling procedure. It was found that ANN had a higher ability to
   predict the adsorption process under different experimental conditions,
   and could be applied for the development of an automated dye wastewater
   removal plant. Also the maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) indicated
   that the qmax value for Fe3O4-WNS for removal of cationic dyes was
   comparable or better than that for some reported adsorbents. Also it
   should be cited that exhausted Fe3O4-WNS was regenerated using
   dishwashing liquid, and reused for removal of the cited dye species from

   long cycle lengths}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{165-173}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several utilities have increased the output power of their nuclear power
   plant to increase their income and profit. Thus, the utility increases
   the power density of the reactor, which has other consequences. One
   consequence is to increase the depletion of the fuel assemblies (FAs)
   and reduce the end-of-cycle (EOC) sum of fissionable nuclides in each
   FA, Sigma(EOC). The power density and the Sigma(EOC) remaining in the
   FAs at EOC must be sufficiently large in many FAs when designing the
   loading pattern, LP, for the first and reload cycles to maintain
   constant cycle lengths at minimum fuel cost. Also of importance is the
   cycle length as well as several other factors. In fact, the most
   important result of this study is to understand that the Sigma(EOC) in
   the FAs must be such that in the next cycle they can sustain the energy
   during depletion to prevent too much power shifting to the fresh FAs
   and, thus, sending the maximum peak pin power, PPPn, above its
   constraint. This paper presents new methods for designing the LPs for
   the initial and follow on cycles to minimize the fuel costs. Studsvik's
   CMS code system provides a 1000 MWe LP design in their sample inputs;
   which is applied in this study. The first 3 cycles of this core are
   analyzed to minimize fuel costs, and all three cycles have the same
   cycle length of similar to 650 days. Cycle 1 is designed to allow many
   used FAs to be loaded into cycles 2 and 3 to reduce their fuel costs.
   This could not be achieved if cycle I was a low leakage LP (Shi et al.,
   2015). Significant fuel cost savings are achieved when the new designs
   are applied to the higher leakage LP designs. There are many factors,
   such as the core power density, cycle length, fuel cost, time between
   core shutdown and return to power, cost of replacement power during
   shutdown, loss of income during shutdown, cost of storing used FAs, and
   the income accrued over the same period of operation, which the
   utilities must consider when trying to increase their profit. The
   purpose of this paper is to provide the information to give guidance in
   making these decisions. Relative cost calculations are presented in
   establishing this guidance by comparing the utility's profit accrued
   over a total cycle for the different core designs and cycle lengths. (C)

Abstract = {{Macrophytes have been used as bioindicators for eutrophication

   due to morphological similarity. Therefore, phylogenetic structure
   within N. marina s.l. was investigated using nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and
   chloroplast (trnL-F) DNA sequence data from over a hundred accessions,
   representing three of the 12 subspecies and one of four varieties in N.
   marina. The samples group in two distinct clusters, which could be
   correlated to the two karyotypes previously reported. The clusters
   differ in 45 positions of ITS and 10 of trnL-F, respectively, with
   almost no variation within. Conflicting placement in the nuclear and
   chloroplast tree supported by cloning of heterozygotic samples
   identified hybrids in four cases. The clear-cut molecular
   differentiation in spite of morphological similarity identifies both
   lineages as distinct but cryptic species (N. marina and N. major). Based
   on our modified concept and the uncertainty introduced by former

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{95-106}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a multi-objective, simulation-based optimization
   framework is developed for supply chain inventory optimiiation. In this
   context, a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a number of plants
   is considered. The plants use a periodic-review order-up-to level policy
   and request premium freights from the supplier in case of a risky
   inventory position. Under this setting, the aim of the study is to
   determine supplier flexibility and safety stock levels that yield the
   best performance in terms of holding cost and premium freights.
   Accordingly, a decomposition-based multi-objective differential
   evolution algorithm (MODE/D) is developed for the proposed framework. As
   the proposed framework considers both holding cost and premium freight
   performance, it enables the managers to determine the best tradeoff
   between the objectives. Consequently, managers have a broad decision
   spectrum in determining supplier flexibility and safety stock levels.
   The proposed framework is implemented to a real world multi-national
   automotive supply chain. Purposely, the results obtained by the proposed
   framework with MODE/D are compared with the results of non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and current operating condition
   of the supply chain. The results reveal that MODE/D yields better
   holding cost and premium freight performance than those of NSGA-II and
   current operating condition of the supply chain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{High sugary corn genotypes (Zea mays L.) have the potential to reduce
   enzyme consumption and enhance ethanol yield during dry-grind ethanol
   production. In the present work, four high sugary and four parent field
   corn genotypes (HSGs and PFCs, respectively) were studied comparatively
   to evaluate agronomic performance and kernel composition of the
   genotypes, as well as predict the effects of these traits on
   carbohydrate accumulation in the kernels. The corn genotypes were grown
   over two cropping years (2012 and 2013) under rain fed conditions, and
   some important agronomic traits and kernel biochemical components were
   determined. Both HSGs and PFCs varied in the agronomic properties, but
   these variations were not atypical in HSGs if compared with those of
   PFCs. The average grain yield ranged from 6.19 Mega gram per hectare
   (Mg/ha) to 9.43 Mg/ha in HSGs and 5.77 Mg/ha to 10.23 Mg/ha in PFCs.
   Sugar accumulation in the kernels was found to be negatively correlated
   with flowering time, grain filling period and physiological maturity of
   the genotypes. Compared with PFCs, a higher amount of total soluble
   sugars (TSS) and a lower quantity of starch were recorded in HSGs, which
   resulted a significant negative correlation between kernel starch and
   TSS. The agronomic performance and kernel composition of HSGs,
   particularly with high kernel sugars and low starch contents suggest
   that these corn genotypes could be promising candidates for producing
   cost-effective ethanol during dry-grind process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Digitalis L. (Foxglove, Plantaginaceae) genus is a representative of
   several medicinal ornamental plants that are widely used in the
   production of herbal medicines. Since the eighteenth century, human
   civilizations have been using the extracts from several Digitalis
   species for treating heart-related ailments. The active ingredient in
   the medicine is cardiac glycosides. Cardenolides, which are constituents
   of cardiac glycosides, have an important role in tumor therapy. Certain
   pharmacologically active compounds including cardenolides are isolated
   from plants, as the structural complexity of cardenolides impede an easy
   chemical synthesis. In modern plant biotechnology research, production
   of cardenolides in large-scale using in vitro techniques has become the
   need of the hour. The reasons are twofold: first, to reduce the
   excessive use of natural Digitalis population and second, to improve the
   plant quality vis-a-vis genetic preservation of the superior seeds for
   future use. The production of useful secondary metabolites depends on
   the overall wellness of the plant from which extraction is to be made.
   The subject matter of this review includes concurrent development and
   propagation of several Digitalis species based on direct and indirect
   regeneration methods. Herein, a compilation of up-to-date published
   research reports on in vitro culture of Digitalis L has been presented,
   including the authors' latest and yet-to-be-published work on Digitalis
   davisiana Heywood. The important steps to be followed for the
   implementation of any plant improvement/preservation program must
   include topic-wise requirements at various stages of micro propagation
   (viz., culture establishment, shoot multiplication, root induction and
   acclimatization) and also the requirements for plant regeneration (viz.,
   somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis). These have been reviewed
   thoroughly and different methods for the in vitro production of
   cardenolides have been discussed. Critical comments on the prospects of
   highly scalable cultures and their importance to meet the ever-growing
   demand for Digitalis-derived products in pharmaceutical industries, have
   also been included. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some regions of the world suffers of drought which affects plant
   behavior regarding biochemical and yield responses. This study aimed to
   estimate the general and specific combining abilities of coriander
   (Coriandrum sativum L.) by analyzing its fruit yield, essential oil
   content (EOC) and fatty oil content (FOC). To reach this aim, 15
   half-diallel hybrids and their six parents, selected for their different
   response to water stress in fruit yield, essential oil and fatty oil
   content were evaluated under well-watered, moderate water-stressed and
   severe water-stressed conditions in the field and in glasshouse
   cultivation systems. Fruit yield in the field (FYF) and glasshouse
   (FYG), percent of de-hulled fruit, percent of hulls, EOC, essential oil
   yield (EOY), de-hulled fruit fatty oil content (DFFOC), hull fatty oil
   content (HFOC), fatty oil content (FOC) and fatty oil yield (FOY) were
   examined. Water treatment (WT), genotype and genotype x WT effects were
   significant (P <= 0.01) for all measured traits. For FYF, gene action
   was mostly additive while dominance was more important for FYG.
   Genotypes gained different EOC and FOC in different WTs. Genetic control
   of the EOC was affected by water stress and the portion of dominance in
   gene action increased as water stress progressed leading to completely
   dominant genetic control of EOC under severe water stress. For FOC and
   FOY genetic control was governed by dominant and over dominant gene
   nature in all WTs. Parents including P-1, P-4 and P-6 were indicated as
   promising hybrid contributors for high EOC, DFFOC and FOY. Similar
   genetic control mechanisms of the EOC, EOY, FOC and FOY suggests that
   improvement of essential oil content and fatty oil content could be
   simultaneously achieved in coriander. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Jojoba, Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schneider, a desert shrub belongs to
   family Simmondsiaceae. In the current study the cumulative molecular and
   phytochemical approach is used to investigate 18 different accessions of
   Simmondsia chinensis collected from AJORP (Association of Rajasthan for
   Jojoba Plantation and Research Project), Rajasthan (Jaipur). The focus
   of this study was the correlation of molecular and phytochemical
   characters at the intraspecific level. DNA fingerprinting of jojoba
   accessions was performed using RAPD markers along with the fatty acid
   profiling of its oil using GC-MS technique. Both molecular analysis and
   biochemical fingerprinting cumulatively revealed a significant level of
   variability among accessions. Ten major fatty acids were found in all
   the accessions, out of them oleic acid (OA) was in high concentration.
   Further OA content of individual accession was correlated with RAPD
   analysis data. High OA containing accessions were grouped together in a
   single cluster. On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that
   three accessions which were grouped in a single cluster 2a (82-18,48-25
   and 58-5) are the best. Thus, these accessions could be better
   candidates for different commercial applications. Our data strongly
   suggest that cumulative approach (molecular and biochemical) proved to
   be best for accessing the relationship between different accessions of
   jojoba in future breeding programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ten parental lines diverse in fruit biochemical traits were crossed in a
   half-diallel mating design to produce 45 F-1 hybrids. A total of 55
   genotypes were evaluated for fruit biochemical traits and dry fruit

   combining abilities that facilitate in designing the best strategy for
   breeding peppers for industrial use. Different proportions of hybrids
   with positive to negative heterosis were obtained for different traits.
   The IHR3849 x IHR3448 F-1 hybrid showed high standard heterosis for dry
   fruit yield per plant (35.42\%{*}{*}) and total capsaicinoid content
   (13.75\%{*}{*}). Estimates of combining ability effects showed that
   IHR500, IHR2451, and IHR4516 were the most suitable parents for
   developing hybrids for dry products processing industries. Both additive
   and dominance components were found significant in controlling the
   biochemical traits; the predominance of the additive effect was observed
   in capsaicinoids and dominance was observed for carotenoids. The results
   suggest that biparental mating, recurrent selection, single seed descent
   method, and heterosii breeding are the best approaches for breeding
   peppers for high carotenoids. Reciprocal recurrent selection at early
   stages is the best approach for breeding for a high dry pepper yield

Abstract = {{Oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) is the most favorite spice plant for the
   production of natural antioxidants which may vary considerably among
   different varieties, landraces and accessions. Genetic variability in
   antioxidant capacity of oregano accessions from German National Genebank
   was studied by measuring oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC),
   total phenolic content (TPC), rosmarinic acid content and essential oil
   content. In total, 42 accessions of Origanum vulgare from oregano
   collection of the genebank in Gatersleben (Germany) were evaluated. Of
   these 42 accessions, 19 accessions belonged to subspecies vulgare, 6
   accessions to viride, 2 accessions to virens, 3 accessions to hirtum and
   1 accession to gracile. The subspecies, to which the remaining 11
   accessions belonged, were not known. The plants were cultivated in a pot
   experiment with 8-10 replications for each accession at the research
   station Rauischholzhausen from 2007 to 2008. The aerial parts of plants
   were harvested at the full flowering stage. The results demonstrated a
   broad variability among accessions and subspecies. The difference
   between the highest and lowest values was 2-fold for ORAC and TPC, while
   6-fold differences were found for rosmarinic acid content. For essential
   oil content the differences between the lowest and highest values were
   almost 100-fold. The correlation between ORAC and TPC was moderately
   close (r = 0.60, n = 352). Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)
   correlated neither to rosmarinic acid content nor to essential oil
   content. Total phenolic content (TPC) correlated moderately to
   rosmarinic acid content (r = 0.39, n = 352) as well as to essential oil
   content (r = 0.25, n = 352). The variation in antioxidant capacity can
   not be explained by the variation in the contents of rosmarinic acid or
   essential oil. The diversities in antioxidant capacity of oregano found
   in this study will allow a better plant exploitation for pharmaceutical
   uses and plant breeding of highly antioxidative genotypes of Origanum
   vulgare. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ISSR and morphological markers were used to assess the genetic variation
   in 117 ajowan accessions belonging to 25 populations collected from
   different geographical regions in Iran. For this purpose, fifteen primer
   combinations were applied to produce 120 polymorphic bands. The
   dendrogram delineated ajowan accessions into three major groups based on
   STRUCTURE software analysis. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)
   confirmed the results of cluster analysis but morphological
   classification showed no significant relationships with molecular
   results. Among the populations, Farsfars and Yazmol exhibited a
   relatively high genetic distance (0.54) but they possessed relatively
   low (255.16 gr/m(2)) and high (435.9 gr/m(2)) seed yields, respectively.
   Esfahfo and Yazsad populations exhibited a relatively high genetic
   distance (0.64) as well as high essential oil content (5.37\% and
   4.73\%, respectively). While only about 30.33\% of the total genetic
   variation was detected among the populations, 64.65\% of the total
   variation was observed within the populations. The populations
   investigated showed a high genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.35) and a
   low gene flow (Nm = 1.85). From among the populations, the Eastern and
   Western ones accounted for the highest values of percentage of
   polymorphic loci PPL (\%), Shanon index (I), and heterozygosity. The
   results of population structure analysis revealed high admixture of

Abstract = {{The effect of variability in renewable input sources on the optimal

   Firstly, possible energy system designs are generated by solving a

   minimize the capital cost for a number of input scenarios. Two measures
   of reliability, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and energy
   index of reliability (EIR), are then evaluated for each design based on
   the minimization of the external energy required to satisfy load demands
   under a variety of input conditions. Two case studies of mining
   operations located in regions with different degrees of variability are
   presented. The results show that the degree of variability has an impact
   on the design configuration, cost and performance, and highlights the
   limitations associated with deterministic decision making for high

Title = {{Genetic Diversity in Barley and Wheat for Tolerance to Soil Constraints}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Surface soil sodicity as well as subsoil salinity, acidity, and
   phytotoxic concentrations of chloride (Cl) are major soil constraints to
   crop production in many soils of sub-tropical, north-eastern Australia.
   The identification of genotypes tolerant to these soil constraints may
   be an option to maintain and improve productivity on these soils. We
   evaluated performance of 11 barley and 17 wheat genotypes grown on two
   sites <0.5 km apart. Compared to the non-sodic site, the sodic site had
   significantly higher Cl concentration (>800 mg.Cl.kg(-1)) in the subsoil
   (0.9-1.3 m soil depth) and higher exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP)
   (>6\%) in the surface and subsoil. Barley grain yield and plant
   available water capacity (PAWC) were reduced between 5\%-25\% and
   40\%-66\%, respectively, for different genotypes at the sodic site as
   compared to the non-sodic site. For wheat genotypes, grain yield was
   between 8\% and 33\% lower at the sodic site compared to the non-sodic
   site and PAWC was between 3\% and 37\% lower. Most barley and wheat
   genotypes grown at the sodic site showed calcium (Ca) deficiency
   symptoms on younger leaves. Analysis of the youngest fully mature leaf
   (YML) confirmed that genotypes grown at the sodic site with Ca
   concentration <0.2\% exhibited deficiency symptoms. Grain yields of both
   barley and wheat genotypes grown on the sodic and non-sodic sites
   increased significantly with increasing Ca and K in YML and decreased
   significantly with increasing Na and Cl concentrations in YML. Sodium
   (Na) concentrations in YML of wheat genotypes grown at the sodic site
   were 10-fold higher than those from the non-sodic site whereas this
   increase was only two-fold in barley genotypes. In step-wise regression,
   the PAWC of barley and wheat genotypes grown on sodic and non-sodic
   sites was the principal determinant of variability of barley and wheat
   grain yield. Including the Ca concentration in the YML of wheat
   genotypes and K: Na ratio in the YML of barley genotypes significantly
   improved the prediction of grain yield in the regression analysis.
   Barley genotypes, Mackay and Kaputar, were relatively susceptible while
   Baronesse and Grout were relatively more tolerant to sodicity. Wheat
   genotypes Gregory and Stampede were generally relatively more
   susceptible to sodicity, and genotypes Baxter, Hume, and the
   experimental line HSF1-255 were relatively more tolerant than the former

Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple crop that feeds more than
   one half of the world's population and is the model system for
   monocotyledonous plants. However, rice is very sensitive to salinity and
   is the most salt sensitive cereal crop with a threshold of 3 dSm 1 for
   most cultivated varieties. Despite many attempts using different
   strategies to improve salinity tolerance in rice, the achievements so
   far are quite modest. This review aims to discuss challenges that hinder
   the improvement of salinity stress tolerance in rice as well as
   potential opportunities for enhancing salinity stress tolerance in this
   important crop.}},

Title = {{GlnR and PhoP Directly Regulate the Transcription of Genes Encoding
   Starch-Degrading, Amylolytic Enzymes in Saccharopolyspora erythraea}},

Abstract = {{Starch-degrading enzymes hydrolyze starch-and starch-derived
   oligosaccharides to yield glucose. We investigated the transcriptional
   regulation of genes encoding starch-degrading enzymes in the industrial
   actinobacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. We observed that most genes
   encoding amylolytic enzymes (one alpha-amylase, one glucoamylase, and
   four alpha-glucosidases) were regulated by GlnR and PhoP, which are
   global regulators of nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, respectively.
   Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reverse transcription-PCR
   (RT-PCR) analyses demonstrated that GlnR and PhoP directly interact with
   their promoter regions and collaboratively or competitively activate
   their transcription. Deletion of glnR caused poor growth on starch,
   maltodextrin, and maltose, whereas overexpression of glnR and phoP
   increased the total activity of alpha-glucosidase, resulting in enhanced
   carbohydrate utilization. Additionally, transcript levels of amylolytic
   genes and total glucosidase activity were induced in response to
   nitrogen and phosphate limitation. Furthermore, regulatory effects of
   GlnR and PhoP on starch-degrading enzymes were conserved in Streptomyces
   coelicolor A3(2). These results demonstrate that GlnR and PhoP are
   involved in polysaccharide degradation by mediating the interplay among
   carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate metabolism in response to cellular
   nutritional states. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism
   underlying carbohydrate metabolism, and suggests new possibilities for
   designing genetic engineering approaches to improve the rate of
   utilization of starch in actinobacteria.
   IMPORTANCE
   The development of efficient strategies for utilization of
   biomass-derived sugars, such as starch and cellulose, remains a major
   technical challenge due to the weak activity of associated enzymes.
   Here, we found that GlnR and PhoP directly regulate the transcription of
   genes encoding amylolytic enzymes and present insights into the
   regulatory mechanisms of degradation and utilization of starch in
   actinobacteria. Two nutrient-sensing regulators may play important roles
   in creating a direct association between nitrogen/phosphate metabolisms
   and carbohydrate utilization, as well as modulate the C: N: P balance in
   response to cellular nutritional states. These findings highlight the
   interesting possibilities for designing genetic engineering approaches
   and optimizing the fermentation process to improve the utilization
   efficiency of sugars in actinobacteria via overexpression of the glnR
   and phoP genes and nutrient signal stimulation.}},

Title = {{Listeria monocytogenes in Stone Fruits Linked to a Multistate Outbreak:
   Enumeration of Cells and Whole-Genome Sequencing}},

Abstract = {{In 2014, the identification of stone fruits contaminated with Listeria
   monocytogenes led to the subsequent identification of a multistate
   outbreak. Simultaneous detection and enumeration of L. monocytogenes
   were performed on 105 fruits, each weighing 127 to 145 g, collected from
   7 contaminated lots. The results showed that 53.3\% of the fruits
   yielded L. monocytogenes (lower limit of detection, 5 CFU/fruit), and
   the levels ranged from 5 to 2,850 CFU/fruit, with a geometric mean of
   11.3 CFU/fruit (0.1 CFU/g of fruit). Two serotypes, IVb-v1 and 1/2b,
   were identified by a combination of PCR- and antiserum-based serotyping
   among isolates from fruits and their packing environment; certain fruits
   contained a mixture of both serotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP)-based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis clustered isolates
   from two case-patients with the serotype IVb-v1 isolates and
   distinguished outbreak-associated isolates from pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE)-matched, but epidemiologically unrelated,
   clinical isolates. The outbreak-associated isolates differed by up to 42
   SNPs. All but one serotype 1/2b isolate formed another WGS cluster and
   differed by up to 17 SNPs. Fully closed genomes of isolates from the
   stone fruits were used as references to maximize the resolution and to
   increase our confidence in prophage analysis. Putative prophages were
   conserved among isolates of each WGS cluster. All serotype IVb-v1
   isolates belonged to singleton sequence type 382 (ST382); all but one
   serotype 1/2b isolate belonged to clonal complex 5.
   IMPORTANCE
   WGS proved to be an excellent tool to assist in the epidemiologic
   investigation of listeriosis outbreaks. The comparison at the genome
   level contributed to our understanding of the genetic diversity and
   variations among isolates involved in an outbreak or isolates associated
   with food and environmental samples from one facility. Fully closed
   genomes increased our confidence in the identification and comparison of
   accessory genomes. The diversity among the outbreak-associated isolates
   and the inclusion of PFGE-matched, but epidemiologically unrelated,
   isolates demonstrate the high resolution of WGS. The prevalence and
   enumeration data could contribute to our further understanding of the
   risk associated with Listeria monocytogenes contamination, especially
   among high-risk populations.}},

Title = {{Genetic Diversity and Origins of the Homoploid-Type Hybrid Phytophthora
   x alni}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the process that gives rise to hybrid pathogens is central to
   understanding the evolution of emerging plant diseases. Phytophthora
   xalni, a pathogen of alder, results from the homoploid hybridization of
   two related species, Phytophthora uniformis and Phytophthora
   xmultiformis. Describing the genetic characteristics of P. xalni should
   help us understand how reproductive mechanisms and historical processes
   shaped the population structure of this emerging hybrid pathogen. The
   population genetic structure of P. xalni and the relationship with its
   parental species were investigated using 12 microsatellites and one
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker on a European collection of 379
   isolates. Populations of P. xalni were dominated by one multilocus
   genotype (MLG). The frequency of this dominant MLG increased after the
   disease emergence together with a decline in diversity, suggesting that
   it was favored by a genetic mechanism such as drift or selection.
   Combined microsatellite and mtDNA results confirmed that P. xalni
   originated from multiple hybridization events that involved different
   genotypes of the progenitors. Our detailed analyses point to a
   geographic structure that mirrors that observed for P. uniformis in
   Europe. The study provides more insights on the contribution of P.
   uniformis, an invasive species in Europe, to the emergence of
   Phytophthora-induced alder decline.
   IMPORTANCE
   Our study describes an original approach to assess the population
   genetics of polyploid organisms using microsatellite markers. By
   studying the parental subgenomes present in the interspecific hybrid P.
   xalni, we were able to assess the geographical and temporal structure of
   European populations of the hybrid, shedding new light on the evolution
   of an emerging plant pathogen. In turn, the study of the parental
   subgenomes permitted us to assess some genetic characteristics of the
   parental species of P. xalni, P. uniformis, and P. xmultiformis, which
   are seldom sampled in nature. The subgenomes found in P. xalni represent
   a picture of the ``fossilized{''} diversity of the parental species.}},

Abstract = {{In Australia Bt cotton has been planted since 1996, and has greatly
   improved the control of its key target Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner).
   There is no strong evidence that genetically modified cotton has been
   selected for significant physiological resistance to Bt toxin in field
   populations. There are many possible explanations for the lack of
   apparent selection that range from high compliance with the resistance
   management strategy for this technology to a lack of behavioral
   preference in key traits such as oviposition that could favor survival.
   To date most experiments that test oviposition of H. armigera on Bt
   cotton vs. conventional cotton have been done with susceptible moths. We
   determine the oviposition preference of a field isolated Bt resistant
   line of H. armigera and a susceptible counterpart when given a choice of
   non-Bt cotton and Bt-cotton with the same genetic background, and test
   whether there is any relationship between oviposition site selection
   (different plant structures) and the survival of the first instar
   larvae. Within cotton plants, our experiments consistently showed that
   both resistant and susceptible moths did not choose plants or plant
   parts that were less toxic in terms of Bt toxin on which to lay eggs.
   There was one exception in that susceptible moths were more likely to
   lay eggs on squares of Bt cotton plants than squares of non-Bt cotton.
   As expected, the mortality of susceptible H. armigera neonates was
   significantly higher on structures of Bt cotton plants than on those
   structures of conventional cotton, and survival was greater on flowers
   than on other structures of Bt cotton. This confirms opportunities for
   selection for resistance, and demonstrates no advantage in this respect
   to carrying resistance genes that might overcome the Bt toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Asexual reproduction is very common in invasive insect pest. In the
   recent years, increasing evidences have shown that some invasive asexual
   lineages display an outstanding capacity to predominate in space and
   persist on time (superclones). However, little is known about the
   host-use behavior of these superclones. The English grain aphid Sitobion
   avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the major pests of
   cereals worldwide. Chilean populations of the grain aphid are
   characterized by a high degree of heterozygosity and low genotypic
   variability across regions and years, with only four predominant
   superclone genotypes representing nearly 90\% of populations. In this
   study, (1) the reproductive performance and (2) the probing behavior
   followed a host shift of one superclone and one non-superclone of S.
   avenae, were compared. The host plant in the superclone did not affect
   the reproductive performance, while in the non-superclone was lower on
   highly defended wheat seedling. The experimental switching of the host
   plants from barley (without chemical defenses) to two wheat species with
   low and high levels of chemical defenses, revealed that superclone
   exhibited a flexible probing activities related to access of sieve
   elements, while the non-superclone exhibited rigid responses. These
   findings are consistent with the pattern of occurrence of these
   genotypes in the field on cereals with different plant defenses (e.g.
   benzoxazinoids). These responses are discussed on the view of developing
   new strategies for the management in invasive populations of aphid pest
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Broccoli is an important vegetable crop belonging to the genus of

   this study, an efficient shoot regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation system was established. The optimum medium for shoot
   induction was selected for three types of explant including hypocotyl,

   including hygromycin concentration for selection and the Agrobacterium
   density yielding the highest transformation frequency. Among the three
   types of explants, peduncle explants showed the highest response to this
   procedure, and the highest frequency of transformation (3.4\%) was

Abstract = {{Sorghum is, globally, the fifth most important cereal after maize, rice,
   wheat and barley. The crop is tolerant to semi-arid and arid climatic
   conditions. Twenty-five sorghum varieties grown in South Africa were
   evaluated in the field at two locations with the objective of
   identifying high yielding, micronutrient dense genotypes. Two clusters
   were formed based on measured traits. Tx430 (G13), CIMMYT entry 49
   (G12), E35-1 (G16), Framida (G19), IS1934 (G7) and IS14380 (G14) formed
   cluster A. The rest of the sorghum entries formed cluster B. Wide
   variation was exhibited for grain yield, ranging from 1.12 t ha(-1) to
   3.96 t ha(-1) with a mean grain yield of 2.83 tha(-1). Analysis of
   variance also revealed significant differences among the varieties for
   protein, total starch, amylose and mineral content. Two varieties, Tx430
   and AR-3048 exhibited very high protein content. Fe content ranged from
   43.7 mg kg(-1) (Kuyuma) to 61.2 mg kg(-1) (IS14380) with an average of
   50.5 mg kg(-1). Zn content ranged from 13.7 mg kg(-1) (Macia) to 23.4 mg
   kg(-1) (Tx430) with a mean of 17.4 mg kg(-1). Grain yield was
   significantly positively correlated with plant height, panicle weight
   and thousand kernel weight. Significant positive correlations were
   observed between Fe content and Zn, Cu, Mn and P. This data indicated
   that simultaneous genetic improvement of sorghum varieties for Fe and
   other important minerals, and starch content in the same genetic
   background was possible, without a penalty to grain yield.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of pre-commercial
   tending and commercial thinning on the genetic diversity parameters,
   especially rare allele loss and diameter-heterozygosity associations, in
   Scots pine stands by retrospectively modelling the removal of
   inferior/superior trees. Modelling was based on empirical data of DNA
   polymorphism in (a) a 60-year-old natural stand and (b) a 20-year-old
   young stand planted with seeds collected in a seed orchard. Within each
   of these stands, approximately 400 trees were systematically sampled
   within 1-ha plots (800 trees in total) and genotyped at 5 neutral and 7
   EST-derived nuclear microsatellite markers. There was no significant
   association between heterozygosity, common allele number and tree
   diameter in either stand. Even at a high intensity, both simulated
   tending and commercial thinning had minor effects on the heterozygosity
   and allelic diversity but caused a significant loss of rare alleles.
   However, there was a nonlinear relationship between the loss of rare
   alleles and the thinning intensity in the young stand, such that below

Abstract = {{Interactive effects of multiple environmental stresses are predicted to
   have a negative effect on cotton growth and development and these
   effects will be exacerbated in the future climate. The objectives of
   this study were to test the hypothesis that cotton cultivars differ in
   their responses to multiple environmental factors of (CO2) {[}400 and
   750 A mu mol center dot mol(-1) (+(CO2)], temperature {[}28/20 and
   20/12A degrees C (-T)], and UV-B radiation {[}0 and 10 kJ center dot
   m(-2)center dot d(-1) (+ UV-B)]. A genetic and molecular standard (TM-1)
   and three modern cotton cultivars (DP1522B2XF, PHY496W3R, and
   ST4747GLB2) were grown in eight sunlit, controlled environment chambers
   with control treatment 400 A mu mol center dot mol(-1) {[}CO2], 28/21A
   degrees C temperature, and 0 kJ UV-B. The results showed significant
   differences among the cultivars for most of the shoot and root
   parameters. Plants grown under low temperature alone or as a combination
   with + UV-B treatment caused more detrimental effects on root and shoot
   vigor. Although the elevated CO2 treatments weakened the damaging
   effects of higher UV-B levels on cotton growth on all cultivars,
   increased CO2 could not mask the negative effects of low temperature.
   When comparing all cultivars, genetic standard TM-1 produced the
   smallest values for the majority of traits under CO2, UV-B, and low
   temperature either alone or in combination with other treatments. Based
   on principal component analysis, the four cultivars were classified as
   tolerant (DP1522B2XF), intermediate (PHY496W3R and ST4747GLB2) and
   sensitive (TM-1) to multiple environmental stresses.Low temperature was
   identified as the most damaging treatment to cotton early seedling vigor
   while elevated CO2 caused the least. Existing variability of cotton
   cultivars in response to multiple environmental stresses could allow for
   selection of cultivars with the best coping ability and higher lint
   yield for future climate change environments.}},

Abstract = {{Unreduced gametes, sperm or egg cells with the somatic chromosome
   number, are an important mechanism of polyploid formation and gene flow
   between heteroploid plants. The meiotic processes leading to unreduced
   gamete formation are well documented, but the relative influence of
   environmental and genetic factors on the frequency of unreduced gametes
   remain largely untested. Furthermore, direct estimates of unreduced
   gametes based on DNA content are technically challenging and, hence,
   uncommon. Here, we use flow cytometry to measure the contribution of
   genetic (hybridization) and environmental (nutrient limitation,
   wounding) changes to unreduced male gamete production in Brassica napus,
   Sinapis arvensis and two hybrid lines. Treatments were applied to
   greenhouse grown plants in a random factorial design, with pollen
   sampled at two time intervals. Overall, the frequency of unreduced
   gametes averaged 0.59\% (range 0.06-2.17\%), plus a single outlier with
   27\%. Backcrossed hybrids had 39 to 75\% higher unreduced gamete
   production than parental genotypes, averaged across all treatments,
   although the statistical significance of these differences depended on
   sampling period and wounding treatment. Unreduced gamete frequencies
   were higher for the second sampling period than the first. There were no
   direct effects of wounding or nutrient regime. Our results indicate that
   both genetic and environmental factors can induce increased unreduced
   gametes, highlighting the potential importance of environmental
   heterogeneity and genetic composition of populations in driving
   polyploid evolution.}},

Title = {{Relative strength of fine-scale spatial genetic structure in paternally
   vs biparentally inherited DNA in a dioecious plant depends on both sex
   proportions and pollen-to-seed dispersal ratio}},
Journal = {{HEREDITY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In plants, the spatial genetic structure (SGS) is shaped mainly by gene
   dispersal and effective population density. Among additional factors,
   the mode of DNA inheritance and dioecy influence SGS. However, their
   joint impact on SGS remains unclear, especially in the case of
   paternally inherited DNA. Using theoretical approximations and computer
   simulations, here we showed that the relative intensity of SGS measured
   in paternally and biparentally inherited DNA in a dioecious plant
   population depends on both the proportion of males and the
   pollen-to-seed dispersal ratio. As long as males do not prevail in a
   population, SGS is more intense in paternally than biparentally
   inherited DNA. When males prevail, the intensity of SGS in paternally vs
   biparentally inherited DNA depends on the compound effect of sex
   proportions and the pollen-to-seed dispersal ratio. To empirically
   validate our predictions, we used the case of Taxus baccata, a dioecious
   European tree. First, we showed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in T.
   baccata is predominantly (98\%) paternally inherited. Subsequently,
   using nuclear DNA (nuDNA) and mitochondrial microsatellite data, we
   compared the fine-scale SGS intensity at both marker types in two
   natural populations. The population with equal sex proportions showed
   stronger SGS in mtDNA than in nuDNA. On the other hand, we found lower
   SGS intensity in mtDNA than in nuDNA in the population with 67\% males.
   Thus, the empirical results provided good support for the theoretical
   predictions, suggesting that knowledge about SGS in paternally vs
   biparentally inherited DNA may provide insight into effective sex
   proportions within dioecious populations.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal foraging behaviour by nectavores is expected to result in a
   leptokurtic pollen dispersal distribution and predominantly
   near-neighbour mating. However, complex social interactions among
   nectarivorous birds may result in different mating patterns to those
   typically observed in insect-pollinated plants. Mating system, realised
   pollen dispersal and spatial genetic structure were examined in the
   bird-pollinated Eucalyptus caesia, a species characterised by small,
   geographically disjunct populations. Nine microsatellite markers were
   used to genotype an entire adult stand and 181 seeds from 28 capsules
   collected from 6 trees. Mating system analysis using MLTR revealed
   moderate to high outcrossing (t(m) = 0.479-0.806) and low estimates of
   correlated paternity (r(p) = 0.136 +/- s.e. 0.048). Paternity analysis
   revealed high outcrossing rates (mean = 0.72) and high multiple
   paternity, with 64 different sires identified for 181 seeds. There was a
   significant negative relationship between the frequency of outcross
   mating and distance between mating pairs. Realised mating events were
   more frequent than expected with random mating for plants <40 m apart.
   The overall distribution of pollen dispersal distances was platykurtic.
   Despite extensive pollen dispersal within the stand, three genetic
   clusters were detected by STRUCTURE analysis. These genetic clusters
   were strongly differentiated yet geographically interspersed,
   hypothesised to be a consequence of rare recruitment events coupled with
   extreme longevity. We suggest that extensive polyandry and pollen
   dispersal is a consequence of pollination by highly mobile honeyeaters
   and may buffer E. caesia against the loss of genetic diversity predicted
   for small and genetically isolated populations.}},

Abstract = {{As deforestation and urbanization continue at rapid rates in tropical
   regions, urban forest patches are essential repositories of
   biodiversity. However, almost nothing is known about gene flow of
   forest-dependent tree species in urban landscapes. In this study, we
   investigated gene flow in the insect-pollinated, wind-dispersed tropical
   tree Koompassia malaccensis in and among three remnant forest patches in
   the urbanized landscape of Singapore. We genotyped the vast majority of
   adults (N = 179) and a large number of recruits (N = 2103) with 8 highly
   polymorphic microsatellite markers. Spatial genetic structure of the
   recruit and adult cohorts was significant, showing routine gene
   dispersal distances of similar to 100-400 m. Parentage analysis showed
   that 97\% of recruits were within 100 m of their mother tree, and a high
   frequency of relatively short-distance pollen dispersal (median similar
   to 143-187 m). Despite routine seed and pollen dispersal distances of
   within a few hundred meters, interpatch gene flow occurred between all
   patches and was dominated by pollen movement: parentage analysis showed
   76 pollen versus 2 seed interpatch dispersal events, and the seedling
   neighborhood model estimated similar to 1-6\% seed immigration and
   similar to 21-46\% pollen immigration rates, depending on patch. In
   addition, the smallest patch (containing five adult K. malaccensis
   trees) was entirely surrounded by 42.5 km of `impervious' substrate, yet
   had the highest proportional pollen and seed immigration estimates of
   any patch. Hence, contrary to our hypothesis, insect-mediated gene flow
   persisted across an urban landscape, and several of our results also
   parallel key findings from insect-pollinated canopy trees sampled in
   mixed agricultural-forest landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Ginger is an economically important and valuable plant around the world.
   Ginger is used as a food, spice, condiment, medicine and ornament. There
   is available information on biochemical aspects of ginger, but few
   studies have been reported on its molecular aspects. The main objective
   of this review is to accumulate the available molecular marker
   information and its application in diverse ginger studies. This review
   article was prepared by combing material from published articles and our
   own research. Molecular markers allow the identification and
   characterization of plant genotypes through direct access to hereditary
   material. In crop species, molecular markers are applied in different
   aspects and are useful in breeding programs. In ginger, molecular
   markers are commonly used to identify genetic variation and classify the
   relatedness among varieties, accessions, and species. Consequently, it
   provides important input in determining resourceful management
   strategies for ginger improvement programs. Alternatively, a molecular
   marker could function as a harmonizing tool for documenting species.
   This review highlights the application of molecular markers (isozyme,
   RAPD, AFLP, SSR, ISSR and others such as RFLP, SCAR, NBS and SNP) in
   genetic diversity studies of ginger species. Some insights on the
   advantages of the markers are discussed. The detection of genetic
   variation among promising cultivars of ginger has significance for
   ginger improvement programs. This update of recent literature will help
   researchers and students select the appropriate molecular markers for
   ginger-related research.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing of complete genomes has given researchers
   unprecedented levels of information to study the multifaceted
   evolutionary changes that have shaped elite plant germplasm. In
   conjunction with population genetic analytical techniques and detailed
   online databases, we can more accurately capture the effects of
   domestication on entire biological pathways of agronomic importance. In
   this study, we explore the genetic diversity and signatures of selection
   in all predicted gene models of the storage starch synthesis pathway of
   Sorghum bicolor, utilizing a diversity panel containing lines
   categorized as either Landraces' or Wild and Weedy' genotypes. Amongst a
   total of 114 genes involved in starch synthesis, 71 had at least a
   single signal of purifying selection and 62 a signal of balancing
   selection and others a mix of both. This included key genes such as
   STARCH PHOSPHORYLASE 2 (SbPHO2, under balancing selection), PULLULANASE
   (SbPUL, under balancing selection) and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases
   (SHRUNKEN2, SbSH2 under purifying selection). Effectively, many genes
   within the primary starch synthesis pathway had a clear reduction in
   nucleotide diversity between the Landraces and wild and weedy lines
   indicating that the ancestral effects of domestication are still clearly
   identifiable. There was evidence of the positional rate variation within
   the well-characterized primary starch synthesis pathway of sorghum,
   particularly in the Landraces, whereby low evolutionary rates upstream
   and high rates downstream in the metabolic pathway were expected. This
   observation did not extend to the wild and weedy lines or the minor

Abstract = {{The developmental variation in stem height with respect to stem diameter
   is related to a broad range of ecological and evolutionary phenomena in
   trees, but the underlying genetic basis of this variation remains
   elusive. We implement a dynamic statistical model, functional mapping,
   to formulate a general procedure for the computational identification of
   quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control stem height-diameter
   allometry during development. Functional mapping integrates the
   biological principles underlying trait formation and development into
   the association analysis of DNA genotype and endpoint phenotype, thus
   providing an incentive for understanding the mechanistic interplay
   between genes and development. Built on the basic tenet of functional
   mapping, we explore two core ecological scenarios of how stem height and
   stem diameter covary in response to environmental stimuli: (i) trees
   pioneer sunlit space by allocating more growth to stem height than
   diameter and (ii) trees maintain their competitive advantage through an
   inverse pattern. The model is equipped to characterize pioneering' QTLs
   (piQTLs) and maintaining' QTLs (miQTLs) which modulate these two
   ecological scenarios, respectively. In a practical application to a
   mapping population of full-sib hybrids derived from two Populus species,
   the model has well proven its versatility by identifying several piQTLs
   that promote height growth at a cost of diameter growth and several
   miQTLs that benefit radial growth at a cost of height growth. Judicious
   application of functional mapping may lead to improved strategies for
   studying the genetic control of the formation mechanisms underlying
   trade-offs among quantities of assimilates allocated to different growth
   parts.}},

Abstract = {{Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from nonenveloped viruses result
   from the self-assembly of capsid proteins (CPs). They generally show
   similar structural features to viral particles but are noninfectious and
   their inner cavity and outer surface can potentially be adapted to serve
   as nanocarriers of great biotechnological interest. While a VLP outer
   surface is generally amenable to chemical or genetic modifications,
   encaging a cargo within particles can be more complex and is often
   limited to small molecules or peptides. Examples where both inner cavity
   and outer surface have been used to simultaneously encapsulate and
   expose entire proteins remain scarce. Here, we describe the production
   of spherical VLPs exposing fluorescent proteins at either their outer
   surface or inner cavity as a result of the self-assembly of a single
   genetically modified viral structural protein, the CP of grapevine
   fanleaf virus (GFLV). We found that the N- and C-terminal ends of the
   GFLV CP allow the genetic fusion of proteins as large as 27 kDa and the
   plant-based production of nucleic acid-free VLPs. Remarkably, expression
   of N- or C-terminal CP fusions resulted in the production of VLPs with
   recombinant proteins exposed to either the inner cavity or the outer
   surface, respectively, while coexpression of both fusion proteins led to
   the formation hybrid VLP, although rather inefficiently. Such properties
   are rather unique for a single viral structural protein and open new
   potential avenues for the design of safe and versatile nanocarriers,
   particularly for the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering of higher plants is orchestrated by complex regulatory
   networks through integration of various environmental signals such as
   photoperiod, temperature, light quality and developmental cues. In
   Arabidopsis, transcription of the flowering integrator gene FLOWERING
   LOCUS T (FT) that several flowering pathways converge to is directly
   regulated by more than ten transcription factors. However, very little
   is known about the transcriptional regulation of the FT homolog SINGLE
   FLOWER TRUESS (SFT) in the day-neutral plant tomato (Solanum
   lycopersicum). Previously, we showed that the zinc finger transcription
   factor SlZFP2 plays important roles in regulation of seed germination
   and fruit ripening in tomato and also found that overexpression of
   SlZFP2 impacted flowering and branching. Here, we characterized in
   detail the early flowering and high branching phenotypes by
   overexpression of this transcription factor. Our data showed that
   overexpression of SlZFP2 accelerated flowering in an SFT-dependent
   manner as demonstrated by elevated SFT expression in the leaves and the
   transcription factor's binding ability to SFT promoter invitro and
   invivo. Furthermore, overexpression of the SlZFP2 gene in the sft plants
   failed to rescue the mutant's late flowering. Through analysis of
   grafting phenotype, growth response of branches to auxin application and
   transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing, we also showed that
   overexpression of SlZFP2 affected shoot apical dominance through
   multiple regulatory pathways. Our results suggest that the transcription
   factor SlZFP2 has potential applications in genetic modification of
   plant architecture and flowering time for tomato production and other
   crops as well.}},

Abstract = {{From 2013 to 2015, incidences of Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV)
   infection were determined in semi-leafless field pea (Pisum sativum)
   crops and trial plots growing in the Mediterranean-type environment of
   southwest Australia. PSbMV was found at incidences of 2 to 51\% in 9 of
   13 crops, 1 to 100\% in 20 of 24 cultivar plots, and 1 to 57\% in 14 of
   21 breeding line plots. Crops and plots of `PBA Gunyah', `Kaspa', and
   `PBA Twilight' were frequently PSbMV infected but none of PSbMV
   resistance gene sbml-carrying `PBA Wharton' plants were infected. In
   2015, 14 new PSbMV isolates obtained from these various sources were
   sequenced and their partial coat protein (CP) nucleotide sequences
   analyzed. Sequence identities and phylogenetic comparison with 39 other
   PSbMV partial CP nucleotide sequences from GenBank demonstrated that at
   least three PSbMV introductions have occurred to the region, one of
   which was previously unknown. When plants of `Greenfeast' and PBA Gunyah
   pea (which both carry resistance gene sbm2) and PBA Wharton and `Yarrum'
   (which carry sbml) were inoculated with PSbMV pathotype P-2 isolate W1,
   resistance was overcome in a small proportion of plants of each
   cultivar, showing that resistance-breaking variants were likely to be
   present. An improved management effort by pea breeders, advisors, and
   growers is required to diminish infection of seed stocks, avoid sbm gene
   resistance being overcome in the field, and mitigate the impact of PSbMV
   on seed yield and quality. A similar management effort is likely to be
   needed in field pea production elsewhere in the world.}},

Abstract = {{Ratoon stunting disease (RSD) is the most economically significant
   disease of sugarcane, and, although it was first discovered in 1945,
   surprisingly little is understood of the nature of the relationship
   between the host and the pathogen, Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli. This
   review traces RSD to the release of modern commercial hybrids, and
   provides evidence that Saccharum officinarum, the major progenitor of
   modern sugarcane cultivars, is not the natural host for L. xyli subsp.
   xyli. Rather, it is proposed that the wild relative, S. spontaneum, is
   more likely to be the original host, and that L. xyli subsp. xyli was
   acquired during interspecific hybridization work undertaken in Java
   during the 1920s. The release of the universally adopted variety POJ2878
   then facilitated the dissemination of a single, worldwide clone of L.

Abstract = {{Botrytis cinerea isolates from pear blossoms (Pyrus communis) in South
   Africa were collected from four orchards in two production areas in the
   Western Cape. The cryptic species status based on
   vegetative-incompatibility alleles of the Bc-hch gene indicated that all
   the isolates belonged to B. cinerea. A microsatellite analysis of B.
   cinerea populations was performed to assess the genetic population
   structure. Total gene diversity (H) was high, with a mean of 0.69 across
   all populations. Some genotype flow was evident between orchards as
   indicated by the spread of microsatellite multilocus genotypes, in
   agreement with the moderate, but significant population differentiation
   among orchards (mean phi(PT)=0.118, P=0.001). Index of association
   analyses (I-A and r \_d) suggest that the populations reproduce mostly
   asexually, even though mating type distribution did not differ
   significantly from a 1:1 ratio, suggesting frequency-dependent
   selection. Isolates resistant to benomyl were evident in one orchard
   only. This orchard was also significantly differentiated from all other
   populations, suggesting infrequent localized selection for benomyl
   resistance. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the dangers of
   a mixed reproduction system, and stress the importance of regularly
   monitoring fungicide resistance levels towards developing more efficient
   management practices.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{141-153}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Arabidopsis thaliana flowering time mutants revealed the function of
   numerous genes that regulate the transition from vegetative to
   reproductive growth. Analyses of their loci have shown that many of them
   act as chromatin modifiers. In this study, a combination of molecular
   and genetic approaches have been implemented, to characterize the
   function of APRF1 (ANTHESIS POMOTING FACTOR 1) gene in A. thaliana and
   to investigate its role in plant development. APRF1 encodes for a low
   molecular weight nuclear WDR protein which displays functional homology
   to the Swd2 protein, an essential subunit of the yeast histone
   methylation COMPASS complex. Compared to WT plants, total
   loss-of-function aprf1 mutants exhibited shoot apical meristem (SAM)
   alterations and increased growth rates. However, the vegetative phase of
   aprf1 plants was prolonged and bolting was delayed, indicating an
   impairment in flowering under long days (LD). On the contrary,
   overexpression of APRF1 accelerates flowering. Consistent with the late
   flowering phenotype, the molecular data confirmed that FLC and SOC1
   expression were significantly altered in the aprf1 mutants. Our data
   suggest that APRF1 acts upstream of FLC and promotes flowering under LD.

Abstract = {{Nuclear and chloroplast markers and phenotypic characters were
   integrated to analyse the population genetic structure of wild cardoon,
   Cynara cardunculus var. sylvestris, the ancestor of cultivated globe
   artichoke, Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus on the island of Sardinia,
   Italy. The spatial scale ranged from a few metres to 200 km. Wild
   cardoon appears to be genetically fragmented, with significant genetic
   divergence at various scales, indicating that gene flow is insufficient
   to counterbalance the effects of genetic drift or founder effects.
   Divergence between populations was higher for chloroplast (40\%) than
   for nuclear markers (15\%), suggesting that gene flow via seed was lower
   than via pollen. Two main genetic groups were detected; these correlated
   with differences in flowering time, capitula size, glossiness, and
   anthocyanin pigmentation. A complex population structure of wild cardoon
   emerged over small spatial scales, likely resulting from the interplay
   between gene dispersal, colonisation history and selective forces.
   Indeed, Sardinia appears to be a `hybrid zone' of different gene pools.
   The island has unique diverse germplasm that has originated from
   hybridisation among different gene pools. The sampling of seeds from a
   few plants but from many sites is suggested as the best strategy to
   harvest the genetic diversity of wild cardoon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Historical migration patterns of boreal and alpine plants have had a
   narrow focus on the Korean Peninsula, generally being characterized as
   southern relics from northern-sourced populations. Here, we present
   another hypothesis for the pattern associated with Korean alpine
   species. A genetic analysis was conducted with Leontopodium japonicum
   Miq., which grows in high mountain ranges with a disjunct distribution
   across Korea, China, and Japan. We inferred its phylogeography using
   sequences of nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (trnL-F, rps16, and
   rpl16) for 11 populations from Korea and adjacent regions. Our molecular
   data (SAMOVA and network analyses) revealed a distinct genetic isolation
   of Korean populations with the highest genetic differentiation (Korea
   vs. China and Japan). By comparison, a nonsignificant level of
   differentiation, but a high degree of genetic diversity, was detected
   between Chinese and Japanese populations, resembling that of
   warm-temperate species. These findings demonstrate that, rather than
   migrating southward from more northern latitudes, current populations in
   Korea are distributed due to colonization via East China Sea land
   bridges, similar to movement by warm-temperate species. Furthermore,
   geographical isolation because of an oceanic barrier has led to
   allopatric speciation for Korean populations. This specific scenario for
   L. japonicum is a meaningful example that will enhance our understanding
   of the history of plants growing in alpine (or subalpine) zones of
   Korea.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP) considers flow over multiple time
   periods in an environment where material flow between departments
   changes over time. These changes render the current facility layout
   inefficient and could increase material handling costs, which results in
   a need for dynamic layout models. But a key factor ignored for
   simplicity in the DFLP literature, is considering the effects of
   non-cooperating internal and external competitions on the mentioned
   changes in facility layout over time that sometimes results in main
   conflict of objectives/goals for these distinct decision makers. To the
   best our knowledge, the existing special literature did not cover this
   important assumption. Ignoring this main assumption resulted in the
   existing monopolistic models for DFLP that cannot satisfy the new needs
   in the nowadays competitive environments. Therefore, in this paper, a
   duopoly Bertrand non-cooperative game model is presented to consider the
   impacts of all conflicting factors on a DFLP for each period and three
   meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed to obtain Nash equilibrium for
   this model. The results obtained from solving some numerical examples
   with these algorithms show that the proposed simulated annealing
   algorithm is more effective than the others for the competitive dynamic
   facility layout problem.}},

Abstract = {{Ethephon (an ethylene releaser) is commonly used to enhance latex
   productivity of rubber tree ( Hevea brasiliensis ), but the underlying
   mechanism has been elusive. The review presents the recent advances in
   understanding the molecular mechanism of increasing latex production in
   rubber tree by ethylene application.
   Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is currently the only commercial
   sources of natural rubber which is an important industrial material.
   Application of ethephon (an ethylene generator) has been a measure
   extensively adopted in worldwide rubber plantations to increase the
   productivity of rubber tree since the 1960s. In the recent years,
   adoption of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches has
   brought great progress in understanding the mechanism of ethylene
   stimulation of latex yield. In this review, an update on the molecular
   mechanism of ethylene stimulation of latex production in H. brasiliensis
   is presented. Ethylene stimulation can be roughly ascribed to the
   acceleration of latex regeneration and the prolongation of the flow of
   latex. The relevant biochemical pathways and processes are
   comprehensively reviewed. The possibility that the limiting factors of
   the biosynthesis of rubber identified in bark glycolysis and
   photosynthetic carbon fixation can be utilized in molecular diagnostic
   and genetic engineering for rubber high-yielding variety improvement is
   discussed. Unsolved problems of the ethylene stimulation and a major
   challenge to understand the regulatory mechanism of the ethylene
   stimulation are also indicated.}},

Abstract = {{An in vitro culture protocol through somatic embryogenesis has been
   established for the F1 hybrid, Santalum yasi x S. album, S. album , and
   S. yasi.
   The spontaneous F1 hybrid, Santalum yasi x S. album and its maternal S.
   yasi and paternal S. album are economically important plant species due
   to their highly valued perfume oils. In vitro plant regeneration from
   nodal segments of these species and hybrid was studied. The optimal
   basal medium for shoot multiplication was Murashige and Skoog (MS)
   supplemented with 2.22-4.44 A mu M 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 1.07-2.69 A
   mu M alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) in S. album x S. yasi and S.
   album or the same concentration range of BA and 2.85-5.71 A mu M
   indole-3-acetic acid for S. yasi. Lower concentrations of BA and NAA
   induced adventitious roots in S. yasi x S. album and S. album.
   Embryogenic callus was induced when S. album x S. yasi and S. album
   nodal segments were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 4.52-9.05 A
   mu M 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D). Friable embryogenic callus
   of S. yasi x S. album was subcultured onto MS medium containing 0.89 A
   mu M BA, 0-0.27 A mu M NAA or 1.44-5.77 A mu M gibberellic acid (GA(3))
   for somatic embryo induction, maturation and germination. A low
   concentration of indole-3-butyric acid (0.98-2.46 A mu M) effectively
   lengthened stunted roots of germinated S. yasi x S. album somatic
   embryos. In S. album, embryogenic callus produced many globular somatic
   embryos when cultured on half-strength MS medium containing only
   0.44-0.89 A mu M BA. These globular somatic embryos were germinated and
   matured on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.44 A mu M BA and
   1.44 A mu M GA(3). On MS medium free of plant growth regulators, S.
   album plantlets regenerated within 20-30 days. This study provides new
   opportunities for the exploitation and utilization of high-yielding
   Santalum species and hybrid.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variations, and especially somaclonal variations, are
   undesirable in genetic transformation. In this study, random amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and coupled restriction enzyme digestion-random
   amplification (CRED-RA) markers were used for detection of the variation
   in calli that were obtained from endosperm-supported mature embryo of
   rye on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing different auxins
   (2,4-D, dicamba and picloram) at a range of different concentrations (2,
   4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mg/L). High level of auxins caused a reduction in the
   genomic template stability (GTS) value. While the highest GTS was
   observed in the calli maintained on MS medium with 2 mg/L dicamba
   (98.4\%), the calli maintained on MS medium with 12 mg/L picloram were
   found to show the least GTS (81.7\%) when RAPD patterns were analysed.
   Epigenetic changes were more frequent and variable than genetic changes
   when compared to RAPD and CRED-RA results. DNA hypermethylation was
   observed at higher concentrations of 2,4-D and picloram, whereas DNA
   hypomethylation was observed in dicamba. These results indicate that
   RAPD and CRED-RA techniques can be used for detection of somaclonal
   variation in in vitro cultures, which is a fundamental step in plant
   genetic transformation.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Polygala lewtonii is a federally endangered, amphicarpic plant with a
   mixed mating system and three types of flowers: (1) aboveground,
   chasmogamous flowers (i.e., open-pollinated; CH), (2) aboveground,
   cleistogamous flowers (i.e., closed, selfing; CL) and (3) CL flowers on
   belowground stems (amphicarpy). Aboveground seeds are ant-dispersed,
   whereas belowground seeds are spaced across the length of the rhizome.
   Here, we collected individuals of P. lewtonii at both range-wide and
   fine geographic scales and genotyped them at 11 microsatellite loci. We
   analyzed patterns of genetic diversity and structure to understand: (1)
   the predominant mating system (selfing or outcrossing), (2) the movement
   of pollen and seeds across the landscape, and (3) the optimal strategy
   to conserve the full range of genetic variation. P. lewtonii reproduces
   predominantly by selfing or bi-parental inbreeding, but reproduction
   occurred through each of the three flower types. Some individuals
   produced by selfing/inbreeding were tightly clustered spatially, and
   were likely produced either by belowground flowers or by aboveground
   flowers with limited seed dispersal. Other selfed/inbred individuals
   were spatially separated (maximum of 15 m), and were likely produced by
   aboveground flowers followed by seed dispersal by ants. Fine-scale
   patterns of genetic structure indicate that some gene flow is occurring
   among aboveground CH flowers but both pollen and outcrossed seeds are
   moving limited distances (maximum of 0.5 km). Because genetic variation
   is structured at a fine spatial scale, protecting many populations is
   necessary to fully conserve the genetic variation in P. lewtonii.
   Conservation seed banking, if accompanied by research on seed
   germination requirements, may also contribute to the effective
   protection of genetic variation in P. lewtonii.}},

Abstract = {{Short-range endemics are high-priority conservation targets, and
   valuable information for their management can be obtained from
   assessments of genetic diversity and structure, including potential
   hybridization with related species, and the investigation of factors
   shaping their patterns of occurrence. The Edough ribbed newt,
   Pleurodeles poireti, is restricted to the Edough Peninsula in Algeria,
   and listed as Endangered in IUCN's Red List. Its range is completely
   surrounded by the more widespread, closely related, Algerian ribbed
   newt, Pleurodeles nebulosus. Here we examined patterns of genetic
   diversity and structure in P. poireti using mtDNA sequences of the ND4
   gene and a suite of 12 polymorphic microsatellites in a sample of 193
   individuals from 46 populations covering the whole range of P. poireti
   and neighboring populations of P. nebulosus. We also investigated the
   influence of environmental variables (climate, topography, soil texture
   and plant cover) on the patterns of occurrence of both species. Genetic
   data allow fine scale delineation of the ranges of the two species and
   provide evidence for hybridization in several localities in a broad area
   of overlap. Niche analyses indicate that P. nebulosus and P. poireti
   tend to occupy similar niches and that the hybrid zone is not associated
   to an ecotone. This suggests that the range boundaries of the two
   species may be constrained by reciprocal exclusion, although in the case
   of P. poireti there are additional environmental constraints. These
   distributional patterns could be explained by high occupation of
   habitats by P. poireti, hindering the penetration of P. nebulosus by a
   `density blocking' effect.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{AimA surprising finding of genetic studies of Phragmites australis is
   that native populations, whether in Europe or North America, are
   characterized by lower genetic diversity than non-native populations.
   What is not clear is whether higher diversity within invasive stands
   results from disturbance facilitating sexual reproduction or whether
   individuals with higher diversity have greater invasion potential.
   LocationUpper Midwest, United States, North America.
   MethodsTo answer this question, we investigated genetic structure of
   native and non-native P.australis stands at multiple spatial scales and
   under differing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Our goals were to
   assess the influence of habitat disturbance on genetic structure and
   determine whether patterns differed in native versus non-native stands.
   We also screened for hybrid genotypes, which have not been reported from
   this region.
   ResultsWhen controlling for disturbance, native and non-native
   P.australis exhibited relatively similar within-site genetic diversity
   and degrees of clonal growth, suggesting that their spread is comparably
   reliant on clonal versus sexual dispersal. In all cases, discrete clumps
   of P.australis were composed of multiple, closely related genotypes,
   indicating seed heads as the key dispersal units. The genetic structure
   of P.australis stands did not differ with disturbance; however, only
   non-native P.australis was found in highly disturbed anthropogenic
   habitats. Native P.australis stands exhibited lower genetic diversity
   overall, lower sexual reproduction in less disturbed sites and greater
   isolation by distance and differentiation among sites, which is
   consistent with its longer residence time in this region. We found no
   evidence of hybrid genotypes, despite native and non-native stands
   sometimes co-occurring.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that invasion by non-native
   P.australis is sporadic, associated with disturbance and involves
   closely related individuals, likely derived from a single seed head. The
   ability of the non-native lineage to exploit a variety of anthropogenic
   habitats helps to explain its invasiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to dissimilar habitats can trigger phenotypic and genetic
   differences between populations, which may, in the absence of gene flow,
   ultimately lead to ecological speciation. Reproductive isolation of
   diverging populations is a critical step at the onset of speciation. An
   excellent example for exploring the extent of reproductive isolation at
   early stages of speciation is provided by Heliosperma pusillum and H.
   veselskyi (Caryophyllaceae), two reciprocally non-monophyletic,
   ecologically differentiated species from the Alps. Interspecific gene
   flow-as revealed by recent genetic studies-is rare even between
   geographically close populations. Cross pollinations and fitness
   experiments revealed no evidence of intrinsic reproductive barriers,
   since fitness parameters measured under uniform conditions were not
   lower in inter- than in intraspecific crosses. Further, morphometric
   analyses of the offspring clearly showed that the differentiation of
   parental species is heritable. As parental phenotypes are likely
   adaptive, the intermediate morphology of hybrids may lead to reduced
   hybrid fitness in parental habitats. Altogether, H. pusillum and H.
   veselskyi provide an increasingly well characterised model system
   offering exciting insights into early stages of ecological speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic mosaics of interspecific interactions can arise as a
   consequence of intrinsic and extrinsic deterministic factors. In this
   study, we took advantage of the recent discovery of a specialist
   leaf-miner (Caloptilia triadicae) on invasive Chinese tallow (Triadica
   sebifera) in the southeastern United States to examine deterministic
   drivers of variation in plant-animal antagonistic interactions. We
   conducted a common garden study to assess the influence of intrinsic
   host genetic variation and extrinsic microenvironment on Triadica traits
   as well as Caloptilia infestation and mortality. We found that tree
   size, branch leaf density, and leaf toughness differed according to
   multilocus estimates of genetic variation. Host genetic variation also
   influenced mortality of early instar Caloptilia, but had little effect
   on peak or late season infestation. Triadica from hyperinvasive
   populations were larger, exhibited reduced leaf density and tougher
   leaves, and had the lowest levels of peak season Caloptilia infestation,
   but also had the lowest levels of early instar mortality. Microhabitat
   variation associated with edge effects influenced tree size as well as
   late season infestation. These findings indicate that
   Caloptilia-Triadica interactions reflect seasonal shifts in the relative
   influence of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers, where peak season
   interactions largely reflect genetic variation in hosts, and late-season
   interactions reflect microenvironmental conditions. Further study of
   Caloptilia infestations could offer additional understanding of novel
   interactions that arise following species introductions.}},

Abstract = {{Mistletoe infection between conspecific and interspecific hosts can be
   restricted by seed dispersal, host-mistletoe compatibility and abiotic
   factors, yet no studies have linked mistletoe infection patterns and
   pollination together for understanding mistletoe distribution at a local
   scale. Psittacanthus calyculatus (Loranthaceae) is a hemiparasitic plant
   with a broad host range across its geographic distribution. The
   potential for local host adaptation has been shown using
   cross-inoculation experiments, in which plants of mistletoe seeds
   collected from a given host are more likely to survive when they are
   inoculated on conspecific host trees compared with those inoculated on
   other host provenances. Here we evaluate host adaptation by describing
   the local patterns of infection (prevalence and intensity) of P.
   calyculatus mistletoes on three native host tree species (Alnus
   acuminata, Quercus crassipes, Salix bonplandiana) and one introduced
   species (Populus alba) and carried out cross-pollination experiments to
   examine how pollination affects infection patterns of different host
   species. Mistletoe infection prevalence (proportion of infection) and
   infection intensity (mean number of mistletoes per tree) were in general
   disproportional with respect to the availability of native host tree
   species but higher to that of non-native host tree species.
   Cross-pollination experiments showed higher mating success on the native
   host tree species, suggesting higher local adaptation to specially Q.
   crassipes. The observed spatial distribution of host tree species and
   mistletoe infection along with the non-random mating could contribute to
   local genetic structuring of mistletoe populations.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence and genetic diversity of human bocaviruses (HBoVs) in
   sewage water samples are largely unknown. In this study, 134 raw sewage
   samples from 25 wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) in Italy were
   analyzed by nested PCR and sequencing using species-specific primer
   pairs and broad-range primer pairs targeting the capsid proteins
   VP1/VP2. A large number of samples (106, 79.1 \%) were positive for
   HBoV. Out of these, 49 were classified as HBoV species 2, and 27 as
   species 3. For the remaining 30 samples, sequencing results showed mixed
   electropherograms. By cloning PCR amplicons and sequencing, we confirmed
   the copresence of species 2 and 3 in 29 samples and species 2 and 4 in
   only one sample. A real-time PCR assay was also performed, using a newly
   designed TaqMan assay, for quantification of HBoVs in sewage water
   samples. Viral load quantification ranged from 5.51E+03 to 1.84E+05 GC/L
   (mean value 4.70E+04 GC/L) for bocavirus 2 and from 1.89E+03 to 1.02E+05
   GC/L (mean value 2.27E+04 GC/L) for bocavirus 3. The wide distribution
   of HBoV in sewages suggests that this virus is common in the population,
   and the most prevalent are the species 2 and 3. HBoV-4 was also found,
   representing the first detection of this species in Italy. Although
   there is no indication of waterborne transmission for HBoV, the
   significant presence in sewage waters suggests that HBoV may spread to
   other water environments, and therefore, a potential role of water in
   the HBoV transmission should not be neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridisation is recognized as a threat to the genetic integrity of
   rare, threatened and vulnerable species. Eucalypts are widely planted
   for plantation forestry and many species readily hybridise making
   ``vulnerable{''}, locally-occurring species potentially at risk of
   genetic swamping. Eucalyptus argophloia (Queensland western gum or
   Chinchilla white gum) is a vulnerable species with limited distribution
   in South Eastern Queensland, Australia. The risks to this species from
   gene flow from surrounding forest or plantations are poorly understood.
   We investigated the breeding system and hybridisation potential of E.
   argophloia by controlled pollinations with selected sympatric and
   allopatric species. Treatments included self-pollination, outcross
   within species and hybridisation with E. crebra, E. microcarpa and E.
   moluccana (from within the same section, Adnataria) and E. pellita and
   E. resinifera (from a more distantly related section, Latoangulatae).
   The aim was to determine the degree of self-pollination and gene flow
   into E. argophloia from closely-related and more distantly-related
   sympatric and allopatric species.
   Eucalyptus argophloia is readily self-fertile. It also hybridises with a
   broad range of intra-sectional and inter-sectional eucalypt species. All
   crosses produced some pollen tubes, capsules and seed, and open
   pollination produced significantly more capsules and seeds than all
   controlled pollinations attempted. The number of seeds per capsule
   pollinated was not significantly different between pollen treatments.
   There is a potential risk of gene flow into E. argophloia populations
   from adjacent natural populations of the species tested as pollen
   parents, or from planted Eucalyptus species. This risk of foreign gene
   flow could be greater with open pollination than indicated by controlled
   pollination in this study because of the limiting effect of bud damage
   incurred during controlled pollinations. The ability to self-pollinate
   in the small population of E. argophloia raises the potential risk of
   genetic swamping from foreign pollen and elevated evolutionary pressure.
   These results will be useful for guiding management of this vulnerable
   species such as limiting plantings of cross-compatible species close to
   existing populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Salinity is one of the major limitations to wheat production worldwide.
   This study was designed to evaluate the level of genetic variation among
   150 internationally derived wheat genotypes for salinity tolerance at
   germination, seedling and adult plant stages, with the aim of
   identifying new genetic resources with desirable adaptation
   characteristics for breeding programmes and further genetic studies. In
   all the growth stages, genotype and salt treatment effects were
   observed. Salt stress caused 33\%, 51\% and 82\% reductions in
   germination vigor, seedling shoot dry matter and seed grain yield,
   respectively. The rate of root and shoot water loss due to salt stress
   exhibited significant negative correlation with shoot K+, but not with
   shoot Na+ and shoot K+/Na+ ratio. The genotypes showed a wide spectrum
   of response to salt stress across the growth stages; however, four
   genotypes, Altay2000, 14IWWYTIR-19 and UZ-11CWA-8 (tolerant) and Bobur
   (sensitive), exhibited consistent responses to salinity across the three
   growth stages. The tolerant genotypes possessed better ability to
   maintain stable osmotic potential, low Na+ accumulation, higher shoot K+
   concentrations, higher rates of PSII activity, maximal photochemical
   efficiency and lower non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), resulting in the
   significantly higher dry matter production observed under salt stress.
   The identified genotypes could be used as parents in breeding for new
   varieties with improved salt tolerance as well as in further genetic
   studies to uncover the genetic mechanisms governing salt stress response
   in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroplast transformation offers a number of advantages over nuclear
   transformation, such as high-level expression, multi-gene engineering in
   a single transformation event, maternal inheritance of transgene, and
   lack of gene silencing and position effects. To date, chloroplast
   transformation technology has become a valuable tool for genetic
   modification in higher plants, especially for dicotyledons and
   chloroplasts it offers a viable alternative to conventional bioreactor
   systems. However, this emerging technology has still not been
   efficiently applied in monocotyledonous cereal crops because of the
   current inability to obtain homoplasmic transplastomic plants. One of
   potentially major obstacles could be the inherently low transformation
   efficiency of exogenous DNA into chloroplast genomes by homologous
   recombination. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)
   have emerged as a newly powerful tool for precise genome editing in
   plants in recent years, and they show great stimulation of the
   homologous recombination DNA-repair pathway via the induction of genomic
   double-strand breaks (DSBs) for gene insertion. Herein in this study, we
   constructed the TALENs targeted for rice chloroplast genome which was
   co-transferred with chloroplast homologous recombination plasmid
   containing hpt (encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase) and EGFP
   (encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein) genes by particle
   bombardment. Results showed that the transformation efficiency for the
   exogenous fragments with assistance from the TALENs was approximately
   two times more than that of solely transforming the chloroplast
   homologous recombination plasmid, preliminarily providing the foundation
   for future experiments to explore the establishment of chloroplast
   transformation system in monocotyledonous crops.}},

   number per panicle, etc. The phenotypic differences between the parents
   and offspring derivatives were further demonstrated at molecular level
   by using a total of 200 SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers to confirm
   genetic polymorphisms among them. Based on allele frequencies obtained
   by genotypic data, molecular statistical analysis suggested that the
   introduction of exogenous DNA mediated by silica nanoparticles into a
   target plant can be a novel approach for producing genetic variation and
   enriching genetic diversity in the progeny.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntz, is a
   perennialwoody plantwidely cultivated for the production of a popular
   non-alcoholic beverage. To rapidly identify and evaluate two different
   color tea varieties (yellowish and purplish), the main phenotypic traits
   and quality componentswere tested in the present study. The metabolic
   profiles of tea shoots and leaves were also analyzed using liquid
   chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry.
   RESULTS: The yellowish variation had a higher active level with respect
   tometabolism of catechins, and the contents of luteolin and kaempferol
   3-alpha-D-glucoside were much higher compared to in the other
   variations. However, the purplish variation had a lowcontent of theanine
   anda high content of caffeine. The contents of quercetin and kaempferol
   3-alpha-D-galactosidewere highest in purplish leaves. Moreover, the
   yellowish variation had the highest total quality scores for green teas
   and black teas, whereas the purplish variation had the highest scores
   for oolong teas.
   CONCLUSION: Both the yellowish variation and the purplish variation
   represent excellent breedingmaterials and are worthy of breeding as new
   tea cultivars. The yellowish variation ismore suitable for making
   high-grade green teas or black teas, whereas the purplish variation is
   suitable for producing fine quality oolong teas. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{In deserts, many plant species exhibit a patchy spatial distribution
   within a harsh habitat matrix, where the likelihood of propagule
   dispersal among patches is uncertain, but may be promoted by landscape
   corridors or dispersal vectors.
   We examine the connectivity of a representative desert plant species
   (Acacia (Senegalia) greggii), and the ability of three major factors
   (animal dispersal agents, water flow along dry-washes, and climate) to
   facilitate dispersal within four watersheds in the Mojave National
   Preserve.
   We genotyped 323 individuals sampled across 22 one-hectare sites using
   ten nuclear microsatellite markers.
   A hierarchical AMOVA revealed no significant differentiation among
   watersheds (F (RT) = 0.00, P > 0.10), and very little genetic structure
   among all sites (F (ST) = 0.03, P < 0.001), indicating regional
   connectivity. Mantel tests indicated distance along dry-washes best
   explained genetic distance between sites (r = 0.47, P < 0.05) when
   compared to Euclidean distance (P > 0.05), a distance measure based on
   rodent dispersal (P > 0.05), and a distance measure avoiding
   inhospitable climate (P > 0.05). An AIC comparison of generalized linear
   models found that within site genetic diversity (H (E) and allelic
   richness) and average relatedness were best explained by slope (which
   increases seed dispersal potential via water flow) and area of the
   upstream watershed (which determines the number of potential seed
   donors), rather than plant density or habitat suitability.
   Together, these findings indicate that dry-washes are key landscape
   features that enhance dispersal and regional connectivity in this patchy
   desert plant.}},

Abstract = {{Transposable elements are key players in eukaryotic genomic diversity.
   Due to their high abundance, great heterogeneity, and replicative
   transposition, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are well
   suited as molecular markers for breeding and biodiversity studies,
   whereas their utilities in non-model organisms have been hindered by the
   lack of prior sequence knowledge. In this study, a putative complete
   (5362 bp) LTR retrotransposon was isolated and characterized in the
   mangrove species Kandelia candel (named KCRE1), and its transcription,
   insertional polymorphisms and copy number variations were also
   investigated. KCRE1 has all the features of a typical copia
   retroelement, and its transcription initiation and termination sites
   were identified by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE),
   respectively. KCRE1 exhibits high sequence similarity with the tomato
   retroelement Rider and is constitutively expressed in the leaf, root,
   flower, and hypocotyl tissues of K. candel. Based on KCRE1,
   sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers were
   developed to explore genetic diversity across 30 individuals from three
   natural populations of K. candel in China. Six primer combinations
   yielded a total of 204 SSAP bands with an averaged percentage of
   polymorphic loci of 55.37 and 41.35 \% at the species and population
   levels, respectively. Each individual had a distinct SSAP phenotype, and
   14-23 unique bands were observed for each population. Accordingly, KCRE1
   was highly abundant in the genome of K. candel and showed considerable
   copy number variation among the three populations. In conclusion, KCRE1
   is the first transcriptionally active retrotransposon reported in K.
   candel, providing a useful tool for the elucidation of untapped genetic
   diversity in mangrove genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields are impacted by overall
   photosynthetic production. Factors that influence crop photosynthesis
   are the plants genetic makeup and the environmental conditions. This
   study investigated cultivar variation in photosynthesis in the field
   conditions under both ambient and higher temperature. Six diverse cotton
   cultivars were grown in the field at Stoneville, MS under both an
   ambient and a high temperature regime during the 2006-2008 growing
   seasons. Mid-season leaf net photosynthetic rates (P (N)) and
   dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence variable to maximal ratios
   (F-v/F-m) were determined on two leaves per plot. Temperature regimes
   did not have a significant effect on either P (N) or F-v/F-m. In 2006,
   however, there was a significant cultivar x temperature interaction for
   P (N) caused by PeeDee 3 having a lower P (N) under the high temperature
   regime. Other cultivars' P (N) were not affected by temperature. FM
   800BR cultivar consistently had a higher P (N) across the years of the
   study. Despite demonstrating a higher leaf F-v/F-m, ST 5599BR exhibited
   a lower P (N) than the other cultivars. Although genetic variability was
   detected in photosynthesis and heat tolerance, the differences found
   were probably too small and inconsistent to be useful for a breeding
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Water stress is a major abiotic constraint leading to serious crop
   losses. Recently, in the Mediterranean region, water stress has become
   markedly sensed, especially in Citrus orchards. This study investigated
   the physiological responses of local sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.)
   clones to severe water stress. Water stress was applied by withholding
   irrigation during weeks, followed by a rewatering phase during three
   months. Under water stress, sour orange clones decreased their stomatal
   conductance, net photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate. On the
   contrary, biomass was stable, especially in the Kliaa clone. In
   addition, reduced leaf water potentials (-3 MPa) and water contents were
   measured in most of the clones, except Kliaa which kept the highest
   water potential (-2.5 MPa). After rewatering, all clones recovered
   except of the Ghars Mrad (GM) clone. Ultrastructural observations of
   leaf sections by transmission electron microscopy did not reveal marked
   alterations in the mesophyll cells and chloroplast structure of Kliaa in
   comparison to the sensitive clone GM, in which palisade parenchyma cells
   and chloroplasts were disorganized. This contrasting behavior was mainly
   attributed to genetic differences as attested by molecular analysis.
   This study highlighted GM as the drought-sensitive clone and Kliaa as
   the tolerant clone able to develop an avoidance strategy based on an
   efficient stomatal regulation. Although a high percentage of
   polyembryony characterizes C. aurantium and justifies its multiplication
   by seeds, heterogeneous water-stress responses could be observed within
   sour orange plants in young orchards.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the effects of waterlogging on the
   growth and photosynthetic characteristics of paired near-isogenic lines
   of waterlogging-tolerant (Zz-R) and waterlogging-sensitive (Zz-S) waxy
   corn inbred line seedlings. All plants were grown until the fifth leaves
   were fully expanded. Subsequently the plants in the pots were submerged
   in water for 4 d. During the waterlogging period, morphological and
   photosynthetic parameters related to waterlogging tolerance were
   examined. After 4 d, a significant decrease was observed in shoot and
   root fresh mass, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance,
   transpiration, water-use efficiency, light-saturation point, maximal
   photosynthetic rate, apparent quantum yield, maximal quantum yield of
   PSII, and effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry in waterlogged
   plants of both genotypes. The Zz-R genotype showed lesser reduction in
   all mentioned indices when compared to the Zz-S genotype. The inhibition
   of photosynthesis under waterlogging occurred due to the reduction in
   stomatal conductance, fluorescence parameters, and chlorophyll content.
   Thus, our study revealed that the Zz-R genotype can be a source of
   genetic diversity for important traits such as morphological and

Abstract = {{Since the early 1990s, ash dieback due to the invasive ascomycete
   Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is threatening Fraxinus excelsior in most of its
   natural range. Previous studies reported significant levels of genetic
   variability in susceptibility in F. excelsior either in field or
   inoculation experiments. The present study was based on a field
   experiment planted in 1995, 15 years before onset of the disease. Crown
   and collar status were monitored on 777 trees from 23 open-pollinated
   progenies originating from three French provenances. Health status was
   modeled using a Bayesian approach where spatiotemporal effects were
   explicitly taken into account. Moderate narrow-sense heritability was
   found for crown dieback (h(2) = 0.42). This study is first to show that
   resistance at the collar level is also heritable (h(2) = 0.49 for collar
   lesions prevalence and h(2) = 0.42 for their severity) and that there is
   significant genetic correlation (r = 0.40) between the severities of
   crown and collar symptoms. There was no evidence for differences between
   provenances. Family effects were detected, but computing individual
   breeding values showed that most of the genetic variation lies within
   families. In agreement with previous reports, early flushing correlates
   with healthier crown. Implications of these results in disease
   management and breeding are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The fruit of the `Dangshansuli' pear has a greenish yellow skin, whereas
   its mutant, the `Xiusu' pear, has a russet skin, which represents a
   genetic variation. It has been demonstrated that the formation of russet
   fruit in the `Xiusu' pear is related to lignin accumulation in skin
   exocarp cells. In this study, we localized hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to
   the cell wall using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   quantified the concentrations of H2O2 and polyamines. In addition, the
   expression levels of genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis were
   measured in the exocarps of samples of young fruits of `Dangshansuli',
   `Xiusu', `Xiusu' treated with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), and
   `Xiusu' treated with ethephon. The results obtained could explain the
   mechanism by which H2O2 participates in polyamine metabolism in the
   lignification of exocarp cells in the russet fruit mutant. The TEM
   results showed that free H2O2 is present near the cell wall, where
   lignin is primarily synthesized, and the H2O2 concentration was highly
   positively correlated with the lignin concentration. Although H2O2
   related to lignification showed no significant correlation with the
   putrescine or spermine concentration, it was highly positively
   correlated with the spermidine (Spd) concentration. Additionally, the
   Spd concentration was significantly positively correlated with altered
   expression of the polyamine oxidase gene (PbPAO). Taken together, these
   results have demonstrated that H2O2 involved in lignification originates
   from the oxidation of Spd by the enzyme PAO, with high expression of the
   PbPAO gene, which suggests that H2O2 from polyamine metabolism affects
   lignification in the exocarp of the russet mutant pear.}},

Abstract = {{The FYVE domain is a typical zinc finger motif containing four conserved
   CxxC pairs and has been shown to specifically binds to PtdIns(3)P on the
   surface of cell membrane. FYVE domain-containing proteins are commonly
   distributed in eukaryotic cells and have been implicated in diverse
   functions like signal transduction, membrane trafficking, exocytosis and
   endocytosis, phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism, and cytoskeletal
   regulation. Analysis of the rice genome using comprehensive online
   databases and research tools resulted in the identification of 19
   putative rice FYVE (OsFVYE) proteins. Based on domain architectural and
   phylogenetic analyses, these OsFYVEs were further classified into six
   groups. Groups I-V were conserved in Arabidopsis (dicots) and rice
   (monocot) at both the genetic and protein levels, while group VI was
   widely present in plants but truncated in Arabidopsis and species of
   Brassicaceae. Comprehensive and comparative investigation of their
   expression profiles showed that FYVE genes in plant exhibited a variety
   of expression patterns during different developmental stages and in
   response to phytohormones and abiotic stresses. These findings indicated
   that both OsFYVE and AtFYVE genes may played potential roles in normal
   plant growth, hormone signal transduction, and abiotic stress tolerance.
   Results from our study shed light on the potential roles of FYVE
   proteins in plant growth, development, and stress responses.}},

Abstract = {{Biofortification of bread wheat by the transfer of useful variability of
   high grain Fe and Zn from Aegilops kotschyi through induced homoeologous

   wheat with those of the related species. The interspecific hybrid plants
   without 5B chromosome showed much higher chromosome pairing than did the
   plants with 5B. The F-1 plants without 5B chromosome were selected and
   repeatedly backcrossed with wheat cultivar PBW343. The chromosome number
   of BC2F1 plants ranged from 43 to 60 with several univalents and
   multivalents. Molecular markers and GISH analysis confirmed the
   introgression of U/S chromosomes of Ae. kotschyi and their fragments in
   wheat. The BC2F2 plants showed up to 125 \% increase in Fe and 158 \%
   increase in Zn compared to PBW343 with Lr24 and Yr36. Induced

Abstract = {{Many invasive plants have long been suspected of firstly being
   introduced and cultivated by a local botanical garden or nursery and
   then escaping into the field after adapting to the novel environment.
   The role of botanical gardens in the spread of invasive plants has not
   yet been explored experimentally. In this article, we studied the
   possible roles of two botanical gardens in the spread of invasive
   Solidago canadensis (Asterceae) in China by analysing genetic
   relationships of invasive and native (United States) populations with
   intersimple sequence repeats markers. Our results showed a high genetic
   variation (mean He=0.292) and a large proportion of genetic variation
   (85.6\%) residing within populations. Solidago canadensis was possibly
   introduced firstly into eastern China. The plants from Lushan Botanical
   Garden showed distant genetic distance from all of the other
   populations, suggesting that this botanical garden had little effect on
   the invasion of S.canadensis. Populations from Wuhan Botanical Garden in
   central China, however, showed close genetic relationships with local
   populations and populations in west and south-west China, suggesting
   gene exchange between these populations. Thus, risk assessment is
   critical for plant introduction and conservation, as introductions of
   alien plants by botanical gardens may facilitate plant invasions, while
   plants conserved in botanical gardens may be at risk by surrounding
   plant invasions.}},

Abstract = {{The Stylosanthes genus stands out among the forage legume species
   well-adapted to the soil and climatic conditions of tropical regions.
   This legume establishes a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing
   bacteria, which can be used to improve the quality of pastures. However,
   there are few studies about the diversity and symbiotic efficiency of
   nitrogen-fixing bacteria in Stylosanthes plants. Therefore, the
   objective was to isolate, characterize and evaluate the symbiotic
   efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in symbiosis with Stylosanthes in
   savanna areas in Roraima, Brazil. Plants with nodules were collected at
   6 sites, including cultivated and native areas of the savanna. Shoots of
   Stylosanthes with flowers were collected to prepare exsiccatae for
   species identification. The nodules were surface-sterilized with 5\%
   sodium hypochlorite after the roots were washed, and isolation and
   morphological characterization were performed in 79 culture medium. The
   isolates were selected according to their morphology, the
   representativeness of each collection site and the associated
   Stylosanthes species. Representative isolates were tested for nodulation
   in cowpea plants, and the isolates able to nodulate the gene 16S rRNA
   was sequenced. The symbiotic efficiency was evaluated in Stylosanthes
   capitata cv. Lavradeiro in greenhouse conditions for 65 days. A total of
   504 nodules were collected, from which 258 pure isolates were obtained
   from 5 species of Stylosanthes (S. capitata,S. scabra, S. gracilis, S.
   humilis and S. angustifolia). The isolates showed significant phenotypic
   diversity, and 89 isolates were selected. Thirty-one isolates were
   confirmed to be nodulating bacteria in cowpea plants. These isolates
   were identified as alpha-Proteobacteria, with Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium
   and Mesorhizobium genera, and beta-Proteobacteria, with Burkholderia and
   Herbaspirillum genera. When evaluated in S. capitata, treatment with two
   Bradyrhizobium isolates, ERR 1178 and ERR 942, resulted in significant
   production of plant biomass production and N accumulation. These results
   indicated that a large diversity of alpha-Proteobacteria and
   beta-Proteobacteria are able to nodulate Stylosanthes spp. and some
   isolates have potential for testing under field conditions. (C) 2016

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars vary extensively in their
   response to acidic soils. In southern Chile, wheat genotypes have been
   selected for growth on acidic Andisols where high concentrations of
   phytotoxic aluminum (Al) limit plant growth. Previous work indicates
   that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play an important role protecting
   plant roots against the deleterious effects of Al. To understand
   interactions between AM fungi and cultivar Al phytotoxicity, six locally
   used wheat cultivars ('Bakan', `Crac', `Invento', `Maxi', `Otto', and
   `Porfiado') were cultivated in a non-limed and limed Andisol (74 and 5\%
   Al saturation, respectively). Plant harvests were carried out at two
   phonological stages: tillering (60 days after sowing, DAS) and
   physiological maturity (150 DAS). Plant growth was limited on non-limed
   soil, but varied by cultivar. Among the cultivars, `Porfiado' and `Crac'
   exhibited growth traits consistently associated with acidic soil
   resistance, including greater biomass and root length and higher P/Al
   and Ca/Al ratios in plants grown in non-limed soil. Wheat growth was
   positively correlated with AM colonized root length and Al bound to
   glomalin related soil protein (Al-GRSP). In addition, root Al
   concentration was negatively correlated with colonized root length and
   Al-GRSP across all wheat cultivars grown under high Al saturation. The
   significantly better performance of wheat cultivars and their
   association with AM fungal traits on non-limed soils indicates that
   indigenous AM fungal populations in acidic soils may contribute to Al
   tolerance of some wheat cultivars when growing at high Al levels. (C)

Abstract = {{Protein phosphatases (PPs) counteract kinases in reversible

   pathway regulating plant responses to stresses and plant development.
   Several studies have provided deep insight into vital roles of the PP2Cs
   in various plant processes. Global analyses of the PP2C gene family in
   model plants have contributed to our understanding of their genomic
   diversity and conservation, across plant species. In this review, we
   discuss the genomic and structural accounts of PP2Cs in plants. Recent
   advancements in their interaction paradigm with ABARs and sucrose

Abstract = {{Common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) is an important forage legume crop. Our

   traits measured were straight length, straight width, width to length
   ratio, curved length, curved width, perimeter, hilum length, 100-seed
   weight and seed shape. The seed trait data were analysed using REML in
   GenStat and the resulting accession-by-trait BLUP mean matrices were
   summarised using a combination of cluster and principal component
   analysis, presented as biplots. There was significant (P<0.05) genotypic
   variation among germplasm accessions, within each subspecies for all the
   traits measured. The calculated seed trait repeatability (R) provided a
   rough estimate of the upper limit of genotypic variation among the
   accessions within the V. sativa and the two subspecies. The magnitude
   and type of association among the seed traits shown in the biplots were
   supported by the estimated phenotypic correlation coefficients. The

   to pirimicarb were less common but widespread. 16\% of samples contained
   both the kdr and MACE mutations. Many unique microsatellite genotypes
   were found, suggesting that M. persicae is holocyclic in Tunisia. There
   were no consistent associations between resistance and microsatellite
   markers.
   CONCLUSIONThis first study of insecticide resistance in M. persicae in
   North Africa showed genetic variation in insecticide resistance within
   microsatellite multilocus genotypes (MLG(M)s) and the same resistance
   mechanisms to be present in different MLG(M)s. This contrasts with
   variation in northern Europe where M. persicae is fully anholocyclic.
   Implications for selection and control strategies are discussed. (c)

Abstract = {{Insects feeding on aboveground and belowground tissues can influence
   each other through their shared plant and this is often mediated by
   changes in plant chemistry. We examined the effects of belowground root
   fly (Delia radicum) herbivory on the performance of an aboveground
   herbivore (Plutella xylostella) and its endoparasitoid wasp (Cotesia
   vestalis). Insects were reared on three populations of wild cabbage
   (Brassica oleracea) plants, exhibiting qualitative and quantitative
   differences in root and shoot defense chemistry, that had or had not
   been exposed to root herbivory. In addition, we measured primary (amino
   acids and sugars) and secondary {[}glucosinolate (GS)] chemistry in
   plants exposed to the various plant population-treatment combinations to
   determine to what extent plant chemistry could explain variation in
   insect performance variables using multivariate statistics. In general,
   insect performance was more strongly affected by plant population than
   by herbivory in the opposite compartment, suggesting that
   population-related differences in plant quality are larger than those
   induced by herbivory. Sugar profiles were similar in the three
   populations and concentrations only changed in damaged tissues. In
   addition to population-related differences, amino acid concentrations
   primarily changed locally in response to herbivory. Whether GS
   concentrations changed in response to herbivory (indole GS) or whether
   there were only population-related differences (aliphatic GS) depended
   on GS class. Poor correlations between performance and chemical
   attributes made biological interpretation of these results difficult.
   Moreover, trade-offs between life history traits suggest that factors
   other than food nutritional quality contribute to the expression of life
   history traits.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Gas Turbine + Multi Effect Desalination + Reverse
   Osmosis (GT + MED + RO) system is designed with respect to Siemens gas
   turbines, to provide water and electricity for Bashagerd County, located
   in the south of Iran (in the outskirts of Persian Gulf). There is 79.2 x
   10(6) (kWh/year) and 103043 (m(3)/day) of electricity and water demand,
   respectively. Siemens GT model 400 (SGT400) is selected to provide
   electricity in the place. It is seen in MED system that there is a major
   difference between desalinated and required water. But, as we have high
   rates of flow in rejected water from MED condenser to the gulf, an RO
   system is used in rejected outflow of the MED system. By doing so, more
   fresh water is derived from the whole system. In this design, the
   recovery of RO system is 42 \%, and final price 2.3 \$ per cubic meter.
   By using GT + MED + RO hybrid system, not only the required electricity,
   but also enough fresh water can be produced for this County. The hybrid
   system had some added costs. And the final price is reduced from 2.8 to
   2.3 \$/m(3) by using the excess electricity to run the RO pump. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Arsenic (As), a naturally-occurring metalloid, is not essential for
   plant growth, but it can accumulate in plants to toxic levels. As a
   result, it can enter the food chain and pose health risk to humans.
   Multiple mechanisms are involved in the uptake and metabolism of As in
   plants. The most toxic forms of this element are As-III and As-v.
   Methylated As and arsenite (as As-III) move through the noduline 26-like
   intrinsic protein (NIP) aquaporin channels while arsenate (as As-v) is
   taken up through the phosphate transporters. In the Pteridaceae family,
   some fern species show hyper-accumulating behavior towards As in
   aboveground tissues. However, generally in plants, the chelation
   phenomenon detoxifies arsenite through complexation with the thiol-rich
   peptide. This comprehensive review encompasses the mechanisms of
   transport, metabolism, and tolerance that plants show in response to As.
   Some recent advancement in plant breeding, genetic modifications and
   remediation approaches to overcome soil and food contamination problems
   are also summarized. We will also evaluate the implications of these new
   findings and assess how this may help in developing the crops that can
   be grown in high As regions and ultimately will be safe for consumers.

Abstract = {{Rapid leaf area development may be attractive under a number of cropping
   conditions to enhance the vigor of crop establishment and allow rapid
   canopy closure for maximizing light interception and shading of weed
   competitors. This study was undertaken to determine (1) if parameters
   describing leaf area development varied among ten peanut (Arachis
   hypogeae L) genotypes grown in field and pot experiments, (2) if these
   parameters were affected by the planting, density, and (3) if these
   parameters varied between Spanish and Virginia genotypes. Leaf area
   development was described by two steps: prediction of main stem number
   of nodes based on phyllochron development and plant leaf area dependent
   based on main stem node number. There was no genetic variation in the
   phyllochron measured in the field. However, the phyllochron was much
   longer for plants grown in pots as compared to the field-grown plants.
   These results indicated a negative aspect of growing peanut plants in
   the pots used in this experiment. In contrast to phyllochron, there was
   no difference in the relationship between plant leaf area and main stem
   node number between the pot and field experiments. However, there was
   genetic variation in both the pot and field experiments in the
   exponential coefficient (PLAPOW) of the power function used to describe
   leaf area development from node number. This genetic variation was
   confirmed in another experiment with a larger number of genotypes,
   although possible G x E interaction for the PLAPOW was found. Sowing
   density did not affect the power function relating leaf area to main
   stem node number. There was also no difference in the power function
   coefficient between Spanish and Virginia genotypes. SSM (Simple
   Simulation model) reliably predicted leaf canopy development in
   groundnut. Indeed the leaf area showed a close agreement between
   predicted and observed values up to 60000 cm(2) m(-2). The slightly
   higher prediction in India and slightly lower prediction in Niger
   reflected GxE interactions. Until more understanding is obtained on the
   possible GxE interaction effects on the canopy development, a generic
   PLAPOW value of 2.71, no correction for sowing density, and a
   phyllochron on 53 degrees C could be used to model canopy development in
   peanut. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Wheat is one of the staple food crops worldwide and breeding for high
   yield wheat is critical to meet the need of increasing world population.
   To determine the factors that limit wheat yield potential in Henan
   province, China, 30 wheat cultivars that have been widely grown in Henan
   province since 1940s were evaluated for grain yield and related
   physiological traits. The results show that grain yield has been
   significantly increased since 1940s, with an annual genetic gain of
   1.09\%, and the increased yield after 1900s was attributed to the
   introduction of 1BL/1RS translocation. The significant yield increase
   mainly resulted from a significant increase in grain number per spike
   (GNPS), thousand kernel weight (TKW) and harvest index (HI), and a
   significant decrease in plant height due to utilization of semi-dwarfing
   genes. The genetic improvement of assimilate accumulation and
   translocation was mainly reflected by the improvement in post-anthesis
   assimilate accumulation (PoAAA) and post-anthesis transportion rate
   (PoATR) of pre-anthesis assimilates (PrAA), with genetic gains of 0.63\%
   and 1.89\%, respectively. The improvement of the PoAAA was closely
   related to an increase in net photosynthetic rates (P-n) of flag leaves
   at anthesis and 20 days after anthesis, and leaf area index (LAI) at 20
   days after anthesis; whereas the improvement of the PoATR of the PrAA
   was closely associated with the improvement of accumulation and
   redistribution of the assimilates accumulated in stems and sheaths. As
   yield increased, the source-sink ratio significantly decreased,
   reflecting that the source has been gradually becoming a limiting factor
   to grain yield increase. Therefore, diverse strategies should be adopted
   to improve biomass (source) in future wheat breeding to meet the need of
   continuous increasing in wheat yield. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Forty-five molecular markers were detected significantly associated with
   chrysanthemum' waterlogging tolerance, and four favorable parental lines
   were identified as potential donors for improving waterlogging tolerance
   in chrysanthemum.
   The productivity of chrysanthemum is downgraded by waterlogging soils,
   which has driven a search for germplasm showing an enhanced level of
   waterlogging tolerance (WT). As yet little is known regarding the mode
   of inheritance of WT in chrysanthemum. The study set out to characterize
   the extent of genetic variation for WT represented in a collection of
   one hundred chrysanthemum accessions by testing them under both
   greenhouse and field conditions. A membership function value of
   waterlogging (MFVW), which integrated a wilting index, a chlorosis score
   and the proportion of dead leaf in waterlogged plants, was used as a
   measure of WT. The variation for MFVW among plants grown in the
   greenhouse (two experiments) was generally higher than that generated in
   field-grown (one experiment) plants. The MFVW broad sense heritability
   was 0.82, and the phenotypic coefficient of variation (31.8 \%) was
   larger than the genetic one (28.8 \%). Association mapping (AM)
   identified 45 markers related to WT: 25 by applying the general linear
   model (GLM) + principal component (PC) model, 16 by applying the mixed
   linear model (MLM), 31 by applying the MLM + Q matrix model and 12 by
   applying the MLM + PC model. Of the associated markers, eight and two
   were predictive in two and three experiments within all models,
   respectively; the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the
   eight associations ranged from 6.3 to 16.4 \%. On the basis of their
   harboring all four of the leading markers E2M16-2, SSR150-6, E19M16-1
   and E10M10-12, the varieties `Nannong Xuefeng', `Qx097', `Nannong
   Xunzhang' and `Finch' were identified as potential donors for future
   improvement of WT in chrysanthemum.}},

Abstract = {{Postharvest biological control agents as a viable alternative to the use
   of synthetic chemicals have been the focus of considerable research for
   the last 30 years by many scientists and several commercial companies
   worldwide. Several antagonists of postharvest pathogens have been
   identified and tested in laboratory, semi-commercial, and commercial
   settings and were developed into commercial products. The discovery and
   development of these antagonists into a product followed a paradigm in
   which a single antagonist isolated from one commodity was also expected
   to be effective on other commodities that vary in their genetic
   background, physiology, postharvest handling, and susceptibility to
   pathogens. In most cases, product development was successfully achieved
   but their full commercial potential was not realized. The low success
   rate of postharvest biocontrol products has been attributed to several
   problems, including difficulties in mass production and formulation of
   the antagonist, the physiological status of the harvested commodity and
   its susceptibility to specific pathogens. All these factors played a
   major role in the reduced and inconsistent performance of the biocontrol
   product when used under commercial conditions. Although many studies
   have been conducted on the mode of action of postharvest microbial
   antagonists, our understanding is still very incomplete. In this regard,
   a systems approach, that takes into account all the components of the
   biocontrol system, may represent the best approach to investigating the
   network of interactions that exist. Very little is known about the
   overall diversity and composition of microbial communities on harvested
   produce and how these communities vary across produce types, their
   function, the factors that influence the composition of the microbiota
   after harvest and during storage, and the distribution of individual
   taxa. In light of the progress made in recent years in metagenomic
   technologies, this technology should be used to characterize the
   composition of microbial communities on fruit and vegetables.
   Information on the dynamics and diversity of microbiota may be useful to
   developing a new paradigm in postharvest biocontrol that is based on
   constructing synthetic microbial communities that provide superior
   control of pathogens. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivorous arthropods can diversify as a consequence of evolutionary
   changes in response to their plant hosts. Current patterns of host
   association of herbivores are likely to reflect a long evolutionary
   history of herbivore-plant co-evolution. Here, we used molecular
   phylogenetics to track the evolutionary history of host shifts and
   diversification of 66 eriophyoid mites (Acari, Eriophyoidea), and linked
   past patterns of evolutionary diversification to more recent patterns of
   divergence by tracking population genetic variation in 13 of the
   eriophyoid mite species feeding on different gymnosperm hosts. This
   allowed us to explore the relationship between a past history of
   diversification and the current potential of mites to undergo host range
   shifts. We found that population-level diversity across gymnosperm hosts
   as measured by 28S rRNA markers was greater in species from the mite
   Glade that had radiated across evolutionary time to utilize a variety of
   hosts including angiosperms, compared to species from the Glade that has
   remained restricted to ancestral gymnosperm hosts. Species from the
   radiated Glade exhibited higher variation in host use. Lineages of mites
   that have in the past been able to radiate and adapt to diverse plants
   may therefore be predisposed to continue their expansion on new hosts,
   although additional Glades need to be tested. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The goals of the present study were to obtain a first estimate of
   intraspecific variability of carbon isotope discrimination () in
   safflower, a thistle-like herbaceous plant, and to determine the
   statistical relationship between and grain yield as well as its
   components in a collection of 45 accessions of different origins. Grain
   yield and aboveground biomass, harvest index, average grain weight, and
   (measured on the bulk leaf organic matter) were investigated in
   experimental field conditions. A large variability was noted for all
   traits but a principal component analysis (PCA) allowed to identify
   several homogeneous groups of accessions. Average grain yield per plant
   varied between 1 and 39 g. varied between 21.3 and 25.2 parts per
   thousand, i.e. a large variation of 3.9 parts per thousand. In our
   experiment, the variation of was not significantly related to that of
   grain yield in the whole accession sample. However, we found contrasting
   trends for this relation within accession groups. These initial results
   motivate further experiments to assess more in depth correlation between
   and yield in safflower and are encouraging regarding the possibility of
   using as an effective selection index in safflower to obtain genotypes
   that efficiently consume water. This study also highlighted one
   accession that combines the two characters required in the Mediterranean
   regions, i.e. high yield performance and high water-use efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Dracocephalum forrestii, an important plant in Tibetan medicine, was
   transformed with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A4 to obtain hairy root
   culture. A maximum transformation frequency of 82\% after seven weeks
   was obtained by inoculation of internodal stem segments. Six lines of
   hairy roots were obtained and cultured in darkness in Woody Plant (WPM)
   liquid medium. The transgenic nature of the hairy roots was investigated
   by PCR and RT-PCR. Three main compounds: rosmarinic acid (RA),
   salvianolic acid B (SAB) and caffeic acid (CA) were identified in
   extracts of D. forrestii hairy roots by UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS analysis.
   Quantitative HPLC analysis showed that RA levels were greatly increased
   in hairy roots (max. 19.97 mg/g DW) compared with the roots of
   one-year-old field grown plants (4.7 mg/g DW), but SAB levels were
   significantly lower in transformed roots (max. 11.7 mg/g DW) than in
   untransformed roots (16.4 mg/g DW). Caffeic acid was detected only in
   transformed roots. A time course experiment with the most productive
   hairy root line showed that a culture period of 30 days and a medium
   supplemented with 3\% of sucrose was optimal for biomass and production
   of analysed phenolic compounds. Production remained stable over at least
   3.5 years of continuous subculturing of the hairy roots. (C) 2016

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies into the estimation and control of an activated sludge
   process (ASP) at a wastewater treatment plant suggest that
   artificial-intelligence methods, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems
   and genetic algorithms, can improve the plant performance in terms of
   reduced operation costs and improved effluent quality. In this paper, a
   neural-network-based soft sensor is developed for the on-line prediction
   of effluent concentrations in an ASP in terms of primary hard-to-measure
   variables, such as chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen content and
   total suspended solids, starting from secondary on-line easy to-measure
   variables, such as oxygen and nitrogen compound concentrations in
   biological tanks, input flow rate and alkalinity, among others. An
   algorithm based on principal component analysis is applied to select the
   optimal net input vectors for the soft sensor, using an appropriated
   number of samples of the secondary variables set. The proposed soft
   sensor is tested on the ASP of a large-scale municipal wastewater
   treatment plant running under the GPS-X simulation frame and validated
   with operational gathered data. Satisfactory low values for mean and
   maximum absolute prediction errors are obtained, even when high values
   of sampling time of primary variables are set, as it is frequently done
   during monitoring operation. In this way, data-driven soft-sensors based
   on neural networks can become valuable tools for plant operators for the
   recognition of operational states in terms of low cost and efficient
   prediction of primary process variables such as chemical oxygen demand,
   total nitrogen content and total suspended solids, therefore avoiding
   the acquisition of expensive and sometimes unreliable instruments for
   measuring nutrient concentrations in plant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Genomic regions responsible for amenability to Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation in barley}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Different plant cultivars of the same genus and species can exhibit
   vastly different genetic transformation efficiencies. However, the
   genetic factors underlying these differences in transformation rate
   remain largely unknown. In barley, `Golden Promise' is one of a few
   cultivars reliable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. By
   contrast, cultivar `Haruna Nijo' is recalcitrant to genetic
   transformation. We identified genomic regions of barley important for
   successful transformation with Agrobacterium, utilizing the `Haruna
   Nijo' x `Golden Promise' F-2 generation and genotyping by 124
   genome-wide SNP markers. We observed significant segregation distortions
   of these markers from the expected 1:2:1 ratio toward the `Golden
   Promise'-type in regions of chromosomes 2H and 3H, indicating that the
   alleles of Golden Promise' in these regions might contribute to
   transformation efficiency. The same regions, which we termed
   Transformation Amenability (TFA) regions, were also conserved in
   transgenic F-2 plants generated from a `Morex' x `Golden Promise' cross.
   The genomic regions identified herein likely include necessary factors
   for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in barley. The potential to
   introduce these loci into any haplotype of barley opens the door to
   increasing the efficiency of transformation for target alleles into any
   haplotype of barley by the TFA-based methods proposed in this report.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide association study (GWAS) reveals the genetic architecture of
   four husk traits in maize}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maize (Zea mays) husk referring to the leafy outer enclosing
   the ear, plays an important role in grain production by directly
   contributing photosynthate and protecting ear from pathogen infection.
   Although the physiological functions related to husk have been
   extensively studied, little is known about its morphological variation
   and genetic basis in natural population.
   Results: Here we utilized a maize association panel including 508 inbred
   lines with tropical, subtropical and temperate backgrounds to decipher
   the genetic architecture attributed to four husk traits, i.e. number of
   layers, length, width and thickness. Evaluating the phenotypic diversity
   at two different environments showed that four traits exhibit broadly
   natural variations and moderate levels of heritability with 0.64, 0.74,
   0.49 and 0.75 for number, length, width and thickness, respectively.
   Diversity analysis indicated that different traits have dissimilar
   responses to subpopulation effects. A series of significantly positive
   or negative correlations between husk phenotypes and other agronomic
   traits were identified, indicating that husk growth is coordinated with
   other developmental processes. Combining husk traits with about half of
   a million of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) via genome-wide
   association study revealed a total of 9 variants significantly
   associated with traits at P < 1.04 x 10(-5), which are implicated in
   multiple functional categories, such as cellular trafficking,
   transcriptional regulation and metabolism.
   Conclusions: These results provide instrumental information for
   understanding the genetic basis of husk development, and further studies
   on identified candidate genes facilitate to illuminate molecular
   pathways regulating maize husk growth.}},

Title = {{Integrating Physiology and Architecture in Models of Fruit Expansion}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Architectural properties of a fruit, such as its shape, vascular
   patterns, and skin morphology, play a significant role in determining
   the distributions of water, carbohydrates, and nutrients inside the
   fruit. Understanding the impact of these properties on fruit quality is
   difficult because they develop over time and are highly dependent on
   both genetic and environmental controls. We present a 3D
   functional-structural fruit model that can be used to investigate
   effects of the principle architectural properties on fruit quality. We
   use a three step modeling pipeline in the OpenAlea platform: (1)
   creating a 3D volumetric mesh representation of the internal and
   external fruit structure, (2) generating a complex network of
   vasculature that is embedded within this mesh, and (3) integrating
   aspects of the fruit's function, such as water and dry matter transport,
   with the fruit's structure. We restrict our approach to the phase where
   fruit growth is mostly due to cell expansion and the fruit has already
   differentiated into different tissue types. We show how fruit shape
   affects vascular patterns and, as a consequence, the distribution of
   sugar/water in tomato fruit. Furthermore, we show that strong
   interaction between tomato fruit shape and vessel density induces,
   independently of size, an important and contrasted gradient of water
   supply from the pedicel to the blossom end of the fruit. We also
   demonstrate how skin morphology related to microcracking distribution
   affects the distribution of water and sugars inside nectarine fruit. Our
   results show that such a generic model permits detailed studies of
   various, unexplored architectural features affecting fruit quality
   development.}},

   floral organ development}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Jatropha curcas seeds are an excellent biofuel feedstock, but seed
   yields of Jatropha are limited by its poor flowering and fruiting
   ability. Thus, identifying genes controlling flowering is critical for
   genetic improvement of seed yield. We isolated the JcLFY, a Jatropha
   ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY (LFY), and identified JcLFY
   function by overexpressing it in Arabidopsis and Jatropha. JcLFY is
   expressed in Jatropha inflorescence buds, flower buds, and carpels, with
   highest expression in the early developmental stage of flower buds.
   JcLFY overexpression induced early flowering, solitary flowers, and
   terminal flowers in Arabidopsis, and also rescued the delayed flowering
   phenotype of lfy-15, a LFY loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant.
   Microarray and qPCR analysis revealed several flower identity and flower
   organ development genes were upregulated in JcLFY-overexpressing
   Arabidopsis. JcLFY overexpression in Jatropha also induced early
   flowering. Significant changes in inflorescence structure, floral
   organs, and fruit shape occurred in JcLFY co-suppressed plants in which
   expression of several flower identity and floral organ development genes
   were changed. This suggests JcLFY is involved in regulating flower
   identity, floral organ patterns, and fruit shape, although JcLFY
   function in Jatropha floral meristem determination is not as strong as
   that of Arabidopsis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{238}},
Pages = {{35-41}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of plant DNA recombination techniques triggered the
   development of a wide range of genetically modified crops. The
   transgenics were the first generation of modified plants; however, these
   crops were quickly questioned due to the artificial combination of DNA
   between different species. As a result, the second generation of
   modified plants known as cisgenic and/or intragenic crops arose as an
   alternative to genetic plant engineering. Cisgenic and/or intragenic
   crops development establishes the combination of DNA from the plant
   itself or related species avoiding the introduction of foreign genetic
   material, such as selection markers and/or reporter genes. Nowadays it
   has been made successful cisgenic and/or intragenic modifications in
   crops such as potato and apple. The present study shows the possibility
   of reaching similar approach in corn plants. This research was focused
   on achieve intragenic overexpression of the maize Rubisco activase (Rca)
   protein. The results were compared with changes in the expression of the
   same protein, in maize plants grown after 23 cycles of conventional
   selection and open field planting. Experimental evidence shows that
   maize intragenic modification is possible for increasing specific gene
   expression, preserving plant genome free of foreign DNA and achieving
   further significant savings in time and man labor for crop improvement.

   yeast and animals. TOR kinase can be efficiently suppressed by rapamycin
   in the presence of functional FK506 Binding Protein 12 KD (FKBP12) in
   yeast and animals. In most examined higher plants rapamycin fails to
   inhibit TOR kinase due to the non-functional FKBP12. Here we find that
   tomato plants showed obvious growth inhibition when treated with
   rapamycin and the inhibitory phenotype is similar to suppression of TOR
   causing by active-site TOR inhibitors (asTORis) such as KU63794,
   AZD8055, and Torin1. The chemical genetic assays using TOR inhibitors
   and heterologous expressing SIFKBP12 in Arabidopsis indicated that the
   TOR signaling is functional in tomato. The protein gel shifting and TOR
   inhibitors combination assays showed that SIFKBP12 can mediate the
   interaction between rapamycin and TOR. Furthermore, comparative
   expression profile analysis between treatments with rapamycin and
   KU63794 identified highly overlapped Differentially Expressed Genes
   (DEGs) which are involved in many anabolic and catabolic processes, such
   as photosynthesis, cell wall restructuring, and senescence in tomato.
   These observations suggest that SIFFBP12 is functional in tomato. The
   results provided basic information of TOR signaling in tomato, and also
   some new insights into how TOR controls plant growth and development
   through reprogramming the transcription profiles.}},

Title = {{GR-independent down-modulation on GM-CSF bone marrow-derived dendritic
   cells by the selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator Compound A}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DC) initiate the adaptive immune response.
   Glucocorticoids (GCs) down-modulate the function of DC. Compound A
   (CpdA, (2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methyl-ethylammonium chloride) is
   a plant-derived GR-ligand with marked dissociative properties. We
   investigated the effects of CpdA on in vitro generated
   GM-CSF-conditioned bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC). CpdA-exposed BMDC
   exhibited low expression of cell-surface molecules and diminution of the
   release of proinflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation; processes
   associated with BMDC maturation and activation. CpdA-treated BMDC were
   inefficient at Ag capture via mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis and
   displayed reduced T-cell priming. CpdA prevented the LPS-induced rise in
   pErk1/2 and pP38, kinases involved in TLR4 signaling. CpdA fully
   inhibited LPS-induced pAkt(Ser473), a marker associated with the
   generation of tolerogenic DC. We used pharmacological blockade and
   selective genetic loss-of-function tools and demonstrated GR-independent
   inhibitory effects of CpdA in BMDC. Mechanistically, CpdA-mediated
   inactivation of the NF-kappa B intracellular signaling pathway was
   associated with a short-circuiting of pErk1/2 and pP38 upstream
   signaling. Assessment of the in vivo function of CpdA-treated BMDC
   pulsed with the hapten trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid showed impaired
   cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity. Collectively, we provide
   evidence that CpdA is an effective BMDC modulator that might have a
   benefit for immune disorders, even when GR is not directly targeted.}},

Title = {{Heat shock transcription factors in banana: genome-wide characterization
   and expression profile analysis during development and stress response}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Banana (Musa acuminata) is one of the most popular fresh fruits.
   However, the rapid spread of fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
   cubense (Foc) in tropical areas severely affected banana growth and
   production. Thus, it is very important to identify candidate genes
   involved in banana response to abiotic stress and pathogen infection, as
   well as the molecular mechanism and possible utilization for genetic
   breeding. Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are widely known for
   their common involvement in various abiotic stresses and plant-pathogen
   interaction. However, no MaHsf has been identified in banana, as well as
   its possible role. In this study, genome-wide identification and further
   analyses of evolution, gene structure and conserved motifs showed closer
   relationship of them in every subgroup. The comprehensive expression
   profiles of MaHsfs revealed the tissue-and developmental stage-specific
   or dependent, as well as abiotic and biotic stress-responsive
   expressions of them. The common regulation of several MaHsfs by abiotic
   and biotic stress indicated the possible roles of them in plant stress
   responses. Taken together, this study extended our understanding of
   MaHsf gene family and identified some candidate MaHsfs with specific
   expression profiles, which may be used as potential candidates for
   genetic breeding in banana.}},
