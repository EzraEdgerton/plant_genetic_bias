To date, little attention has been paid\nto the way in which clonal propagation affects genetic diversity and the\nfine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) of clonal alpine trees. An\nAFLP study was undertaken to quantify the clonal and genetic diversity\nand FSGS of the vulnerable treeline species Polylepis reticulata in\nEcuador. We successfully genotyped 32 and 75 ramets within 4mx100m\n(coarse scale) and 4mx4m (fine scale) transects of one population, respectively. Higher genotypic diversity was detected at the coarse\nscale than at the fine scale, while lower genetic diversity was detected\nfor P.reticulata than other Polylepis spp. at both scales. Significantly\nstronger FSGS was detected at the ramet level than the genet level for\nP.reticulata within a spatial distance of 3m. The studied P.reticulata\npopulation showed pronounced FSGS (Sp=0.012 at the genet level, a\nstatistic reflecting declining pairwise kinship with distance) revealed\nrestricted gene dispersal, which implies restricted seed dispersal for\nthis population, assuming pollen flow is as extensive as that described\nfor other wind-pollinated tree species. Our results revealed that clonal\ndiversity is a function of both sample size and the spatial scale of the\nsampling area. The findings highlights that clonal propagation has\naffected FSGS within a spatial distance of 3m for this species.\nResumen La propagacion clonal es mas frecuente con el aumento de la\naltitud conforme las condiciones ambientales empeoran.

Utilizing a broad spectrum of\ndomesticated and wild C. baccatum germplasm, we utilize AFLP markers to\ndescribe the species' molecular diversity and population structure in\nthe South American gene pool. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)\nrevealed greater genetic diversity in the wild form of C. baccatum (C.\nbaccatum var. baccatum) than in the domesticated form of the species (C.\nbaccatum var. pendulum). Both Bayesian and distance based clustering\nanalysis, as well as principal coordinates analysis (PCA), concordantly\ndemonstrated admixture/shared ancestry between wild and cultivated C.\nbaccatum botanical varieties. Two principal genetic groups were\nidentified in the domesticated C. baccatum accessions largely based on\ntheir geographic distribution in South America. One group was\npredominated by accessions from the western territories of the species'\ndistribution (Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and northwestern\nArgentina) and the second by accessions from the eastern regions, Paraguay and eastern Argentina). The two genetic groups overlapped in\nthe geographic location of present-day Bolivia. The grouping pattern\nsuggested that C. baccatum was domesticated in multiple sites and that\nits evolution took two lineages followed by lineage differentiation. The\nwild accessions most closely related to the cultigens were found in the\nhighlands of Peru and Bolivia, which support the early hypothesis that\nthis region is one of the domestication sites of this species. A\nBayesian assignment analysis demonstrated that Brazilian wild forms of\nC. baccatum were genetically distant to all other accessions and made\nlittle to no contribution to the domesticated genepool. Moreover, results of clustering analysis suggested that C. baccatum likely\noriginated from present day Paraguay. Analysis of inter-specific\nrelationships across selected Capsicum species supported independent\nlineages for the two crossability groups within Capsicum, the baccatum\nspecies-complex (including C. baccatum) and the annuum species-complex\n(including C. annuum, C. chinense and C. frutescens). However, the\nresults did not support taxonomic distinction of C. baccatum var.\numbilicatum from C. baccatum var. pendulum. The present study provides\nnew insights into the domestication of C. baccatum. The results will be\nuseful for identifying accessions for crop improvement and guiding the\ndevelopment of in situ and ex situ conservation programs.",

In Chile, it was\nprobably introduced in pre-Columbian times as a domesticated species and\nis presently grown in the coastal areas of the north-central regions of\nCoquimbo and Valpara so. The species has been bred, but little\ninformation is available on its genetic variability in Chile. To\ncharacterize the genetic variability in this species, fruits were\ncollected from 14 different ecotypes and seeds were sown to generate\napproximately 60 segregants from each accession. Segregants were planted\nat two different locations to characterize their fruits and fruiting\nhabits. Fruit weight ranged from 30 to 485 g, while length was 3.5 to\n16.7 cm, equatorial diameter 3.4 to 9.5 cm, pulp firmness 1.7 to 10 N, and soluble solids content 6.3 to 13.5 degrees Brix. Fruit shape ranged\nfrom flat to oblong. When analyzing the estimated variance components\nwith a mixed linear model, most of the variability between different\necotypes was in fruit shape, length, and weight, which resulted in a\ngenetic contribution of 34.6\\%, 29.3\\%, and 18.1\\% of the total\nvariability of these traits, respectively. Genetic variability was also\nfound for pulp firmness and soluble solids content. Therefore, enough\nvariability is available in seed-propagated pepinos from Chilean\necotypes to allow genetic improvement of these fruit quality traits.\nThere was also variability from genotype x environment interactions;\ntherefore, selections must be performed for specific environments or\nstable selections must be found.",

Over the\npast two decades, `CCN 51' has become one of the most planted cultivars\nin Ecuador, mainly as a result of its high productivity and disease\nresistance. Intermixing of Nacional fine flavor Ecuadorian beans with\nbeans of `CCN 51' has become common practice, reducing overall bean\nquality and decreasing value. The primary goals of this study were to\ndetermine the genetic identity, structure, and allelic richness of `CCN\n51', its maternal origin and to compare `CCN 51's' agronomic\ncharacteristics against a composite group of Nacional cultivars. To\ninvestigate the complex genetic background of this cultivar, 70 simple\nsequence repeat loci were used. The high heterozygosity observed (56 of\n70 loci) for `CCN 51' is not characteristic of traditional Nacional\ncultivars. Comparison of agronomic characteristics between `CCN 51' and\nseveral Nacional cultivars indicates significant differences in cacao\ndry bean weight, yield potential, production efficiency, percent healthy\npods, and witches' broom {[}Moniliophthora perniciosa (Stahel) Aime \\&\nPhillips-Mora] disease incidence. Additionally, physical, chemical, and\norganoleptic characteristics suggest that `CCN 51' is different from\nthose of Nacional lineage. Based on population structure analysis, the\npredominant ancestries for `CCN 51' are Iquitos (45.4\\%), Criollo\n(22.2\\%), and Amelonado (21.5\\%) genetic groups. A lesser proportion of\nits genome was accounted for by genetic groups Contamana (3.9\\%), Purns\n(2.5\\%), Maranon (2.1\\%), and Nacional (1.1\\%) admixtures. Results of\nphylogenetic analyses using the unweighted pair group method with\narithmetic mean yielding high bootstrap values strongly support the\nrelatedness of `CCN 51' with Iquitos, Criollo, and Amelonado genetic\ngroups. Moreover, seven mitochondrial simple sequence repeat loci\nrevealed that `CCN 51' maternally inherited the `IMC 67' cytotype. `CCN\n51' constitutes a valuable cacao genetic resource that is currently used\nnot only in its country of origin, but also in many other national\nbreeding and selection programs worldwide.",

        "abstracttext": "There is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic\npatterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and\nin species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and\nconservation. Such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and\nsubtropical tree species, as many of these species are still\nundomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local\npopulations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further\ndomestication. For many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is\nimportant to sustain local production. Diversity is also crucial for\nspecies to adapt to environmental changes. This paper explores the\npossibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into Geographic\nInformation Systems (GIS) to allow visualization and better\nunderstanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to\noptimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a\ncase study of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.), a Neotropical fruit\ntree species. We present spatial analyses to (1) improve the\nunderstanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya\nnatural stands and cultivated trees in Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru based\non microsatellite molecular markers (SSRs); and (2) formulate optimal\nconservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ\nconservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ\ncollections. We found high levels of allelic richness, locally common\nalleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of\norigin, southern Ecuador and northern Peru, whereas levels of diversity\nin southern Peru and especially in Bolivia were significantly lower. The\napplication of GIS on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more\ndetailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted\ncollection across the Andean distribution range of cherimoya than\nprevious studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in\nEcuador and Peru, respectively.",

We conclude that (1)\nregular gene flow has historically occurred between populations, and (2)\nindividual color morphs are not separate taxa. We identify another\npopulation that should be fenced to ensure maximal protection of genetic\nvariation. Our research serves as a case study of using population\nmolecular genetics for optimizing protection strategies for rare plants\nin tropical archipelagoes affected by introduced herbivores.",

        "abstracttext": "The history of sweet potato in the Pacific has long been an enigma.\nArchaeological, linguistic, and ethnobotanical data suggest that\nprehistoric human-mediated dispersal events contributed to the\ndistribution in Oceania of this American domesticate. According to the\n``tripartite hypothesis,{''} sweet potato was introduced into Oceania\nfrom South America in pre-Columbian times and was then later newly\nintroduced, and diffused widely across the Pacific, by Europeans via two\nhistorically documented routes from Mexico and the Caribbean. Although\nsweet potato is the most convincing example of putative pre-Columbian\nconnections between human occupants of Polynesia and South America, the\nsearch for genetic evidence of pre-Columbian dispersal of sweet potato\ninto Oceania has been inconclusive. Our study attempts to fill this gap.\nUsing complementary sets of markers (chloroplast and nuclear\nmicrosatellites) and both modern and herbarium samples, we test the\ntripartite hypothesis. Our results provide strong support for\nprehistoric transfer(s) of sweet potato from South America (Peru-Ecuador\nregion) into Polynesia. Our results also document a temporal shift in\nthe pattern of distribution of genetic variation in sweet potato in\nOceania. Later reintroductions, accompanied by recombination between\ndistinct sweet potato gene pools, have reshuffled the crop's initial\ngenetic base, obscuring primary patterns of diffusion and, at the same\ntime, giving rise to an impressive number of local variants. Moreover, our study shows that phenotypes, names, and neutral genes do not\nnecessarily share completely parallel evolutionary histories.\nMultidisciplinary approaches, thus, appear necessary for accurate\nreconstruction of the intertwined histories of plants and humans.",

We propose that if the\nassociation of a common plant species with different types of\nenvironment is investigated, by analysing all individuals in a given\npopulation as a single entity, the results might be misleading or\nincomplete owing to intraspecific variation. To test this hypothesis, we\nused molecular markers to classify mature Castanopsis chinensis\nindividuals with a diameter at breast height = 40 cm into different\ngenetic groups and analysed the associations of these groups with\ntopographic features and habitats within a 20-ha Dinghushan forest plot, South China. Our results indicated that the different groups had\ndifferent topographical associations, and that the spatial distributions\nand genetic structures of individuals varied among the groups.\nTherefore, if significant genetic structure exists in the population of\na common species within a community, to understand the relationship\nbetween the spatial distributions of individuals in the population and\nthe environment, it is necessary to classify the individuals into\ngenetic groups and analyse the data for these groups, rather than for a\ncombined group of all individuals.",
