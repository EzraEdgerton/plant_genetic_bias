 the recent acceleration of actions to conserve plant species using ex situ and in situ strategies has revealed the need to understand how these two approaches might be better developed and integrated in their application to tree species here we review some of the recent successes relating mainly to tree seed biology that have resulted in the development and application of innovative actions across five areas i the expansion of living collections to conserve threatened tree species in sufficient numbers to ensure a broad genetic diversity in their progeny ii the generation of viability constants to enable estimates to be made of storage longevity of tree seeds in the dry state iii improvement in the diagnosis of tree seed storage behaviour through the development of predictive models reliable prognoses of desiccation tolerance and use of botanical information systems such as gis to correlate information on species distribution and their physiological characteristics iv advances in storage preservation biotechnology to enhance the future application of cryopreservation procedures to recalcitrant species in biodiversity hotspots where many are under threat of extinction and v integration of ex situ and in situ conservation approaches to ensure that best practice in horticultural and forestry are combined to maintain or enhance genetic diversity especially in high value species and those with small and vulnerable populations these actions can lead to greater impact if supported by greater efforts to create seed banks and to collate databases worldwide so that data knowledge and collections are more available to the scientific forestry and ngo communities throughout this review we have used examples from the megabiodiversity countries of brazil and china as a way of illustrating wider principles that can be applied in many countries future development of current research approaches the adherence to conservation policy and the expanding needs for education are also considered briefly © 2014 the authors stylosanthes spp originated in central and south america consisting of 44 species and subspecies in a promising tropical legume forage it is planted in onethird of the tropical and south subtropical area of the world in terms of variety it mainly regenerates in the form of a seed and it is planted and used in southern china the seed is the conservation of germplasm breeding and material basis and it is important material for physiological studies this study goes into the development of the tropical pasture seed ultradry conservation breeding and germplasm resources for biodiversity conservation and utilization of great significance the ultradried seed storage technique is energy efficient effective and easy to manipulate for seed storing while most tropical crop seeds do not have dehydration tolerance the ultradried storage technique is a constraint in these seeds however our previous study showed that the stylosanthes guianensis seed has very high tolerance to ultradried storage the ultradried seeds of s guianensis with a moisture content of 317 has high tolerance to aging after treatment at 50℃ for 15 days these results show that ultradried treatment could increase the seeds storability of s guianensis the most suitable moisture content is 3±02 for longterm ultradried storing ultradry treatment can improve storage stability however this does not mean that the lower the moisture content the better researches proved that when the moisture content lowered to a certain extent the vitality of the seed dropped too much ultradry treatment does not have a positive effect on the seed longevity in fact it may even decrease it the ultimate aim of seed storage is to preserve the innate hereditary feature and pass it without variation by harmful influences when storing seeds not only should the seeds high germinating ability be preserved but genetic stability should also be kept therefore the detection of the genetic stability of the storage seed was very important in evaluating the storage effects morphologic features cytological markers physiologic and biochemical indexes and molecular researches could be applied in the study of the changes in genetic integrity the purpose of this study was to dertmine the effects of ultradried seed storage for ten years through analyzing the seed germination viability phenology morphological characteristics agronomic traits and genetic stability of stylosanthes guianensis cv reyan no 5 compared to the methods of 20℃ and room temperature storage with three seed storing methods for 10 years a seed with moisture of 317 at ultradry storing a seed with moisture of 87 at 20℃ storing and a seed with moisture of 87 at room temperature storing have a germination potential of 779 713 and 185 respectively and a vitality index of 6010 5079 and 498 respectively both germination potential and vitality index have significant differences between an ultradry seed and a seed with moisture of 87 at 20℃ storage for 10 years there are very significant differences between a seed with moisture of 87 at room temperature storage and a seed in ultradry storage or a seed stored at 20℃ for 10 years the ultradry longterm storage for stylosanthes seeds is the best method among them an investigation on the stylosanthes morphologic characteristics and its aflp molecular analysis showed that the ultradry seed storage does not cause plant morphological phenotypes to change or aflp molecular genetic variation the ultradry storage seed of stylosanthes can greatly reduce the energy in long term storing with characteristics of being simple effective and widely applicable this result will be useful in the field of stylosanthes germplasm conservation and

impact of fragmentation on the genetic structure of fish populations by focusing on the european chub squalius cephalus this fish species is not stocked and copes well with altered habitats enabling an assessment of the effects of fragmentation per se using microsatellites we genotyped 2133 chub from 47 sites within the catchment fragmented by 37 hydroelectric power stations two weirs and the rhine falls the shallow genetic population structure reflected drainage topology and was affected significantly by barriers to migration the effect of power stations equipped with fishpasses on genetic differentiation was detectable albeit weaker than that of manmade barriers without fishpasses the rhine falls as the only longstanding natural obstacle formed 14 000 to 17 000 years ago also had a strong effect manmade barriers also exacerbated the upstream decrease in allelic diversity in the catchment particularly when lacking fishpasses thus existing fishpasses do have the desired effect of mitigating fragmentation but barriers still reduce population connectivity in a fish that traverses fishpasses better than many other species less mobile species are likely to be affected

in the analysis of lncrnas from established plant models arabidopsis maize and rice almost nothing is known about lncrnas from fruit crops including those in the rosaceae family results here we present a genomescale identification and characterization of lncrnas from a diploid strawberry fragaria vesca based on rich rnaseq datasets from 35 different flower and fruit tissues 5884 fvelncrnas derived from 3862 loci were identified these lncrnas were carefully cataloged based on expression level and whether or not they contain repetitive sequences or generate small rnas about one fourth of them are termed highconfidence lncrnas hclncrnas because they are expressed at a level of fpkm higher than 2 and produce neither small rnas nor contain repetitive sequence to identify regulatory interactions between lncrnas and their potential proteincoding pc gene targets pairs of lncrnas and pc genes with positively or negatively correlated expression trends were identified based on their expression these pairs may be candidates of cis or transacting lncrnas and their targets finally blast searches within plant species indicate that lncrnas are not well conserved conclusions our study identifies a large number of tissuespecifically expressed lncrnas in f vesca thereby highlighting their potential contributions to strawberry flower and fruit development and paving the way for future

species is necessary for conservation as well as for taxonomic zoogeographic and evolutionary studies it constitutes a difficult problem but the experience of botany and some branches of zoology gives reasons to believe that it is not unsolvable the following criteria for distinguishing alien beetle species from native ones are proposed based on the criteria developed for plants algae mammals and marine invertebrates 1 detection of an established population of the species which has not been recorded earlier in the region 2 disjunction of the range which cannot be explained by disjunction of suitable landscapes or host plant ranges 3 expansion of a part of the range isolated from its main part 4 highly localized distribution in an area adjacent to a known invasion pathway 5 establishment in other regions 6 dependency on another nonnative species feeding on an alien host plant or animal 7 absence of specific parasites in the given region and their presence in some other region 8 association with anthropogenic biotopes 9 sharp fluctuations of abundance 10 lack of taxonomically close species in the given region and their presence in other regions 11 detection in the region of two or more taxonomically andor ecologically close species typical of another region 12 presence of known vectors of invasion 13 low genetic diversity 14 reproduction by parthenogenesis or inbreeding these criteria are mere indirect evidences of the alien status of a species in the given territory because numerous exceptions exist usually it is impossible to recognize an alien species by a single criterion but matching several criteria characterizes the species as an alien one with high probability © 2016 pleiades publishing inc alpine bluegrass poa alpina l is common in mountain areas where it represents a valuable forage resource and is widely used for ecological restoration of disturbed landscapes this study assessed the variation of germplasm from the rhaetian alps italy both seed production and morphology were examined for potential use in restoration projects and for conservation and selection purposes of local genetic resources the effects of the ex situ growing site were also assessed in two altitudecontrasting sites individual populations harboured great phenotypic diversity for all traits including seed yield while variation among valleys of origin was less manifest noticeable sitespecific population yield responses were observed suggesting that the environment adopted for seed production may steer the choice of materials to be multiplied the longer vegetative period in the lowland site combined with environmenttailored agronomic practices contributed to better plant growth seed yield and survival compared to the mountain site suggesting that seed production of this alpine species could be feasible in a lowland environment when adequate inputs were provided one valley valchiavenna displayed high average levels of seed yield and plant vigour

amino acids that animals are unable to synthesize via de novo pathways recently it has been found that most metazoans lack the same set of enzymes responsible for the de novo eaa biosynthesis here we investigate the sequence conservation and evolution of all the metazoan remaining genes for eaa pathways initially the set of all 49 enzymes responsible for the eaa de novo biosynthesis in yeast was retrieved these enzymes were used as blast queries to search for similar sequences in a database containing 10 complete metazoan genomes eight enzymes typically attributed to eaa pathways were found to be ubiquitous in metazoan genomes suggesting a conserved functional role in this study we address the question of how these genes evolved after losing their pathway partners to do this we compared metazoan genes with their fungal and plant orthologs using phylogenetic analysis with maximum likelihood we found that acetolactate synthase als and betainehomocysteine smethyltransferase bhmt

flowering plants in almost all ecosystems worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning the naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding furthermore bee populations found in humanaltered landscapes such as urban areas can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations in this study we investigated the finescale population structure of the solitary bee colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape first we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nestswe genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals however genetic structure among nest aggregations was low neis ginfstinf  0011 reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations suggesting malemediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size but not with other estimators of genetic diversity we detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding overall these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators © 2015 lópezuribe et al

promising method it has been successfully used with many agricultural species unlike micropropagation cryopreservation has not yet found wider employment with ornamental plants the upcoming years and progress in cryobiology may however change this situation and broaden the potential of cryoconservation over years several freezing methods have been introduced the first one developed based on slow cooling had limited usefulness in temperate species today the encapsulationdehydration technique is most often used with ornamental plants in the future however combined techniques will probably be

physiographic regions across the range of the species to use as surrogates for genetic cus we collected leaf samples from an average of 26 plants from each of 19 of the largest populations across all five physiographic regions and used variable microsatellite and chloroplast dna markers to determine how genetic variation is distributed across the range of the species and how well physiographic

regions we observed little genetic differentiation among populations in the main range of the species which encompasses nearly all of four contiguous physiographic regions however three other distinct genetic groups were identified two in the disjunct northeast corner and one at the southeast edge of the main range modification of the cus to reflect the genetic groups rather than the physiographic regions would result in cus which better reflect historical patterns of population structure moreover use of the genetic units to inform translocation and genetic rescue efforts could improve our

between the benefits of counteracting inbreeding depression via heterosis and the risks of maladaptation and reduced fitness through outbreeding depression in the 1990s populations of the perennial

genetic study using microsatellite markers to assess the temporal dynamics of the genetic composition of reintroduced populations we show that genetic diversity increased significantly in the reintroduced populations compared to the localsource population and that this increased diversity has been maintained for over ten years highlighting the benefits of mixing individuals of multiplesource populations for restoration of small and inbred populations our results also suggest that the level of individual admixture between local and nonlocal genetic sources might affect

analysis of coexpression networks across species can reveal conservation and divergence in the regulation of genesresults we inferred coexpression networks of a thaliana populus spp and o sativa using stateoftheart methods based on mutual information and context likelihood of relatedness and conducted a comprehensive comparison of these networks across a range of coexpression thresholds in addition to quantifying genegene link and network neighbourhood conservation we also applied recent advancements in network analysis to do crossspecies comparisons of network properties such as scale free characteristics and gene centrality as well as network motifs we found that in all species the networks emerged as scale free only above a certain coexpression threshold and that the highcentrality genes upholding this organization tended to be conserved network motifs in particular the feedforward loop were found to be significantly enriched in specific functional subnetworks but where much less conserved across species than gene centrality although individual genegene coexpression had massively diverged up to 80 of the genes still had a significantly conserved network neighbourhood for genes with multiple predicted orthologs about half had one ortholog with conserved regulation and another ortholog with diverged or nonconserved regulation furthermore the most sequence similar ortholog was not the one with the most conserved gene regulation in over half of the casesconclusions we have provided a comprehensive analysis of gene regulation evolution in plants and built a web

genetic integrity in longterm tissue cultured and cryopreserved plants is important for the conservation of plant genetic resources
objective in this study the genetic stability of cryopreserved wasabi shoot tips stored for 10 years at 150 degree c was visualized using amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp and methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism msap
materials and methods the study included plants derived from cryopreserved shoot tips after 105 years storage at 150 degree c ln10yr after 2 h storage at 196 degree c ln2hr cryopreservation controls no ln cooling tc and nontreated controls without ln cooling lc the donor plants for ln2hr tc and lc were also maintained in vitro at 20 degree c for the same period
results neither technique detected genetic variations in either control or cryopreserved plants some mutations were noted in plants maintained in tissue culture for 10 years comparison of genome stability for tc and ln2hr plants showed only a minor change in dna however when comparing the lc and ln10yr many differences were found
conclusion we conclude that cryopreservation is a superior conservation method compared to tissue culture in maintaining genetic stability for a longterm storage of wasabi germplasm over the past decade a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade accusations of biopiracy meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent have taken centre stage leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos indigenous san and khoi have also launched demands—to date unmet—for a stake in rooibos benefits meanwhile smallscale coloured rooibos producers despite their involvement in fair trade remain marginalized all remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity having been propped up by the south african apartheid system the melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as “the mother” and “testing ground” of socalled access and benefit sharing such approaches stem in part from the convention on biological diversity and its nagoya protocol which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge with growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds a surge of patents associated with the plant the successful granting of geographical indication status and threats to the industry of changing climates ecologies and ecosystems the stage is set for a reconceptualization

juvenile plants from the southeastern region of brazil heterozygosity levels differed between the 2 studied life stages as indicated by the fixation index of adult and juvenile trees suggesting that selection against homozygotes occurs during the plant life cycle the mating system parameters analyzed indicate that a aculeata is predominantly outcrossing allogamous however its low levels of selfing suggest that there is individual variation with regard to selfincompatibility which can be a survival strategy in isolated or fragmented habitats deviations in variance effective size were detected because of high mating rates among relatives and correlated matings these findings indicate that the main source of inbreeding results from biparental inbreeding in the population and that

darwins naturalization conundrum states that exotic species closely related to natives should be successful because of a shared affinity for local environmental conditions but at the same time close relatives often compete more intensively limiting niche opportunities for the invaders previous studies have generally considered these two opposing hypotheses as mutually exclusive yet evidence for both of them abounds indicating a practical dilemma for management of biological invasions in this study we sowed the seeds of the invasive exotic ambrosia artemisiifolia l into 369 experimental plant communities to mimic an introduction of the exotics into a series of new habitats we further linked the establishment and growth performance of the invader in these experimental communities to the phylogenetic relatedness between the invader and the community residents where it was introduced we found that the probability of invader establishment declined with increasing phylogenetic distance between the invader and residents whereas the average size of surviving invader individuals increased with the phylogenetic distance these results can be at least partly explained by the observations that close relatives tend to create similar soil microhabitat through harbouring similar soil enzymes eg alkaline and acid phosphatases benefiting invader establishment and that intense competitive interactions between the invader and its close relatives suppressed exotic growth synthesis and applications this study presents the first experimental evidence that phylogenetic relatedness has contrasting effects on different aspects of invader success thus shedding light on the longstanding darwins naturalization conundrum moreover our findings also have important implications for management of plant invasions for controlling invasive species characterized by high establishment probability native species distantly related to the invasive species can be planted in sites surrounding the invasion foci whereas the opposite seems to be true for controlling those characterized by large individual size this study presents the first experimental evidence that phylogenetic

stringent selection process employing the short probe sequence for each snp assay was used to limit the majority of the selected markers to those represented a minimum number of times across the highly replicated genome as a result approximately 60  of the snp assays display genomespecificity resolving as three clearly separated clusters aa ab and bb when tested with a diverse range of b napus material this genome specificity was supported by the analysis of the diploid ancestors of b napus whereby 26504 and 29720 markers were scorable in b oleracea and b rapa respectively fortyfour percent of the assayed loci on the array were genetically mapped in a single doubledhaploid b napus population allowing alignment of their physical and genetic coordinates although strong conservation of the two positions was shown at least 3  of the loci were genetically mapped to a homoeologous position compared to their presumed physical position in the respective genome underlying the importance of genetic corroboration of locus identity in addition the alignments identified multiple rearrangements between the diploid and tetraploid brassica genomes although mostly attributed to genome assembly errors some are likely evidence of rearrangements that occurred since the hybridisation of the progenitor genomes in the b napus nucleus based on estimates for linkage disequilibrium

chromosome 2 dth2 while heading date 1 hd1 also governs hd3a expression to investigate the mechanism of rice adaptation to temperate climates we have analyzed the natural variation of these five genes in a collection of japonica rice representing the genetic diversity of long day cultivated riceresults we have investigated polymorphisms of hd3a rft1 ehd1 hd1 and dth2 in a collection of 57 japonica varieties hd3a and rft1 were highly conserved displaying one major allele expression analysis suggested that rft1 rather than hd3a could be the pivotal gene controlling flowering under long day conditions while few alleles were found in the ehd1 promoter and dth2 coding region a high degree of variation in hd1 including nonfunctional alleles was observed correlation analysis between gene expression levels and flowering periods suggested the occurrence of other factors additionally to ehd1 affecting rft1 regulation in long day adapted cultivarsconclusions during domestication rice expansion was accompanied by changes in the regulatory mechanism of flowering the existence of nonfunctional hd1 alleles and the lack of correlation of their presence with flowering times in plants grown under long day conditions indicate a minor role of this branch in this process and the existence of an alternative regulatory pathway in northern latitudes expression analysis data and a high degree of conservation of rft1 suggested that this gene could be the main factor regulating flowering among japonica cultivars adapted to northern areas in the absence of inhibition exerted by hd1 through repression of hd3a expression the role of ehd1 as a regulator of rft1 and hd3a appears to be reinforced data also indicated the occurrence of additional regulatory factors controlling

that a conserved suite of cazymes is a feature of land plant evolution with similar diversity and complexity regardless of growth habit and form in addition we compared the diversity and levels of cazyme gene expression during wood formation in trees using mrnaseq data from two distantly related angiosperm tree species eucalyptus grandis and populus trichocarpa highlighting the major cazyme classes involved in xylogenesis and lignocellulosic biomass production conclusions cazyme domain ratio across embryophytes is maintained and the diversity of cazyme domains is similar in all land

present in all adult tissues and developmental stages rnase x25 expression is elevated in response to nutritional stresses consistent with the hypothesis that this enzyme has a housekeeping role in recycling rna a correlation between induction of rnase x25 expression and autophagy was observed moreover induction of gene expression was triggered by oxidative stress suggesting that rnase x25 may have additional roles in stress responses phylogenetic analyses of this family in protostomes showed that rnase t2 genes have undergone duplication events followed by divergence in several phyla including the loss of catalytic residues and suggest that rnase t2 proteins have acquired novel functions among those it is likely that a role in host immunosuppression evolved independently in several groups including parasitic platyhelminthes and parasitoid wasps the presence of only one rnase t2 gene in the d melanogaster genome without any other evident secretory rnase activity detected

limit dispersal distances or a pattern of isolation by resistance ibr because the topographical complexity of the mountain range would result in complex dispersal patterns to investigate for the presence of finescale genetic structure in this population we genotyped 153 ringtails at 15 microsatellite loci and described genetic structure using 2 bayesian clustering techniques six genetic clusters were identified revealing complex spatial genetic structure within a localized geographic area we used partial mantel tests to test for a correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance or resistance distance but found no evidence for a genetic pattern related to ibd or ibr we subsequently tested for an association between genetic structure and isolation by environment ibe using a discriminant function analysis and classified a high proportion of individuals  91 to their observed genetic cluster based exclusively on landscape features we also used a nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance to further explore the role of landcover type and found that plant association explained 26 of the genetic variation these results suggest that ibe influences the

schmitzesser müller stessl and wagner plant genetic resources are conserved by genebanks mainly in the form of seeds in most of the cases the dried seeds can be stored for a considerable period of time but eventually seed deterioration results in the inability to generate healthy seedlings prolonging seed longevity during storage reduces the frequency of regeneration which is beneficial from a genetic as well as a management point of view to reduce the rate of deterioration cool and dry storage conditions are usually practised for longterm seed storage in spite of the growing body of evidence that seed deterioration is predominantly caused by oxidative processes the importance of seed storage under anoxic conditions has received little attention from the genebank community herein we report on the effects of anoxia on seed viability the oxygen uptake by dry seeds in closed containers and the permeability for oxygen of various seed storage containers our results confirm that the ageing of dry seeds is accelerated by the presence of oxygen in the storage environment therefore we recommend that genebanks store dry seeds under anoxic conditions to prolong their longevity during ex situ conservation to reduce the initial rate of viability loss we further recommend that the period of temporary storage after seed harvest be minimized and also that the seeds are kept during this period under controlled conditions including anoxia © niab 2014  crop domestication has led to a reduction in genetic diversity within crops as only a narrow range of diversity was selected by early farmers  an effect commonly described as the domestication bottleneck but breeders need all the genetic diversity they can get their hands on to improve the worlds crops many are therefore keen to reach back through the domestication bottleneck to make use of the diversity that can still be found in the ancestors and wild relatives of crops cwr these taxa are increasingly recognized as being of key importance to breeding efforts in general and those that aim to help adapt agriculture to climate change in particular the list of possible traits that could be used to enhance crop adaptation to the worlds new climates is extensive including everything from enhanced root growth to faster grain filling what reasons are there to think that such traits can be found in the generally unimpressivelooking wild and weedy plants that are the closest relatives of crops we know that many cwrs grow in conditions of climate and soil that are marginal for the crop we also know that many show marked differences from the crop such as perenniality fleshy roots and distinct phenology some of these are likely to be of importance for adaptation here we explore how wild plant biodiversity

between genome size and intron length is observed across eukaryotes including angiosperms plants indicating a coevolution of genome size and gene structure conifers have very large genomes and longer introns on average than most plants but impacts of their large genome and longer introns on gene structure has not be describedresults gene structure was analyzed for 35 genes of picea glauca obtained from bac sequencing and genome assembly including comparisons with a thaliana p trichocarpa and z mays we aimed to develop an understanding of impact of long introns on the structure of individual genes the number and length of exons was well conserved among the species compared but on average p glauca introns were longer and genes had four times more intronic sequence than arabidopsis and 2 times more than poplar and maize however pairwise comparisons of individual genes gave variable results and not all contrasts were statistically significant genes generally accumulated one or a few longer introns in species with larger genomes but the position of long introns was variable between plant lineages in p glauca highly expressed genes generally had more intronic sequence than tissue preferential genes comparisons with the pinus taeda bacs and genome scaffolds showed a high conservation for position of long introns and for sequence of short introns a survey of 1836 p glauca genes obtained by sequence capture mostly containing introns 1 kbp showed that repeated sequences were 10× more abundant in introns than in exonsconclusion conifers have large amounts of intronic sequence per gene for seed plants due to the presence of few long introns and repetitive element sequences are ubiquitous in their introns results indicate a complex landscape of intron sizes and distribution

strains were isolated from root nodules of vavilovia formosa plants originated from the north ossetian state natural reserve caucasus russia phylogenetic analysis of these strains was performed using partial 16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer its sequences the results showed that the isolates belong to three families of root nodule bacteria twelve of them were related to the genus rhizobium family rhizobiaceae but four strains can be most probably identified as phyllobacteriumrelated family phyllobacteriaceae bosea and rhodopseudomonasrelated family bradyrhizobiaceae amplified fragment length polymorphism clustering was congruent with its phylogeny but displayed more variability for rhizobium isolates which formed a single group at the level of 30  similarity we expect that the isolates obtained can belong to new taxa at genus species or subspecies levels the results of pcr amplification of the nodulation genes nodc and nodx showed their presence in all rhizobium isolates and one rhodopseudomonasrelated isolate the nodc gene sequences of v formosa isolates were closely related to those of the species rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae but formed separate clusters and did not intermingle with any reference strains the presence of the nodx gene which is necessary for nodulation of afghan peas pisum sativum l originated from the middle east allows the

dispersal ability with those of landscape structure the concept of functional connectivity has been popular for understanding and predicting species spatial responses to environmental change following recent advances the functional connectivity concept is now able to move beyond landscape structure to consider more explicitly how other external factors such as climate and resources affect species movement we argue that these factors in addition to a consideration of the complete dispersal process are critical for an accurate understanding of functional connectivity for plant species in response to environmental change we use recent advances in dispersal landscape and molecular ecology to describe how a range of external factors can influence effective dispersal in plant species and how the resulting functional connectivity can be assessed synthesis we define plant functional connectivity as the effective dispersal of propagules or pollen among habitat patches in a landscape plant functional connectivity is determined by a combination of landscape structure interactions between plant environment and dispersal vectors and the successful establishment of individuals we hope

such as maize corn zea mays l without causing disease it is generally assumed that most endophytes originate from soil if this is true then as humans collected domesticated bred and migrated maize globally from its native mexico they moved the species away from its native population of endophyte donors the migration of maize persists today as breeders collect wild and exotic seed as sources of diverse alleles from sites of high genetic diversity in mexico for breeding programs on distant soils when transported to new lands it is unclear whether maize permits only selective colonization of microbes from the mexican soils on which it coevolved tolerates shifts in soilderived endophytes or prevents colonization of soilbased microbes in favour of seedtransmitted microbes to test these hypotheses nonsterilized seeds of three types of maize predomesticatedmexican ancientmexican moderntemperate were planted sidebyside on indigenous mexican soil canadian temperate soil or sterilized sand the impact of these soil swaps on founder bacterial endophyte communities was tested using 16srdna profiling culturing and microbial trait phenotyping results multivariate analysis showed that bacterial 16srdna trflp profiles from young surfacesterilized maize plants were more similar when the same host genotype was grown on the different soils than when different maize genotypes were grown on the same soil there appeared to be two reasons for this result first the largest fraction of bacterial 16ssignals from soilgrown plants was shared with parental seeds andor plants grown on sterilized sand suggesting significant inheritance of candidate endophytes the in vitro activities of soilderived candidate endophytes could be provided by bacteria that were isolated from sterile sand grown plants second many noninherited 16ssignals from sibling plants grown on geographicallydistant soils were shared with one another suggesting maize can select microbes with similar trflp peak sizes from diverse soils wild predomesticated maize did not possess more unique 16ssignals when grown on its native mexican soil than on canadian soil pointing against longterm coevolutionary selection the modern hybrid did not reject more soilderived 16ssignals than did ancestral maize pointing against such rejection as a mechanism that contributes to yield stability across environments a minor fraction of 16ssignals was uniquely associated with any one soil conclusion within the limits of trflp profiling the candidate bacterial endophyte populations of predomesticated ancient and modern maize are partially buffered against the effects of geographic migration  from a mexican soil associated with ancestral maize to a canadian soil associated with modern hybrid agriculture these

genomes represents an opportunity to investigate how genes involved in diterpene synthesis were acquired by fungi and to assess the consequences of this process on the fungal metabolism results in order to investigate the origin of fungal ditps we implemented a search for potential fungal ditps genes and identified their presence in several unrelated ascomycota and basidiomycota species the fungal ditps phylogenetic tree is functionrelated but is not associated with the phylogeny based on housekeeping genes the lack of agreement between fungal and ditpsbased phylogenies suggests the presence of horizontal gene transfer hgts events further evidence for hgt was provided by conservation of synteny of ditps and neighbouring genes in distantly related fungi conclusions the results obtained here suggest that fungal ditpss originated from an ancient hgt event of a single ditps gene from a plant to a fungus in ascomycota in fungi these ditpss allowed for the formation of clusters consisting in ditps ggpps and p450 genes to create functional clusters that were transferred between fungal species producing diterpenes acting as hormones or toxins thus affecting fungal development

arabidopsis thaliana crossspecies markers and eight for a halleri speciesspecific markers we further characterized 2 million snps across the genome with a pooled wholegenome resequencing approach poolseq results our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from crossspecies and speciesspecific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity ssrh e was not significantly correlated with genomewide snp diversity estimates snph e and θ watterson in a halleri instead microsatellite allelic richness a r was a better proxy for genomewide snp diversity estimates of genetic differentiation among populations f st based on both marker types were correlated but microsatellitebased estimates were significantly larger than those from snps possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used marker ascertainment bias as well as the high variance in microsatellitederived estimates in contrast genomewide snp data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome or only exomewide snps were used further we inferred that a few thousand random snps are sufficient to reliably estimate genomewide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation conclusions we recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations use randomly selected highthroughput sequencingbased snp data to draw conclusions on genomewide diversity patterns in species comparable to a halleri a few thousand

putative zincfinger domain and a conserved gyfdflgl motif in their ctermini the protein sensitive to aba and drought 2 sad2 recognizes the nuclear pore complex which then transports the sad2myb4 complex into the nucleus here we show that the conserved gyfdflgl motif contributes to the interaction between myb factors and sad2 the asp → asn mutation in the gyfdflgl motif abolishes the interaction between myb transcription factors and sad2 and therefore they cannot be transported into the nucleus and cannot repress their target genes we found that myb4d261n loses the capacity to repress expression of the cinnamate 4hydroxylase c4h gene and biosynthesis of sinapoyl malate our results indicate conservation among myb transcription factors in terms of their interaction with sad2 therefore the asp → asn mutation may be used to engineer transcription factors significance statement subgroup 4 r2r3type myb transcriptional repressors repress phenylpropanoid synthesis these transcription factors are translocated to the nucleus by interacting with sad2 an importin here we show that mutating the interaction domain with sad2 can prevent their translocation to the nucleus

only the ultrarapid procedure called vitrification resulted in success whereas conventional slow freezing protocols did not we determined that success also depended on using a thin film of agar with embedded symbiodinium on cryotops a process that yielded a postthaw viability of 50 in extracted and vitrified symbiodinium from fungia scutaria pocillopora damicornis and porites compressa additionally there also was a seasonal influence on vitrification success as the best postthaw survival of f scutaria occurred in winter and spring compared to summer and fall p  005 these findings

brassica and to study evolutionary innovations of the mesohexaploid plant b raparesults three chronological b rapa genomes recent young and old were reconstructed with sequence divergences revealing a trace of recursive wgd events a total of 636 fast evolving genes were unevenly distributed throughout the recent and young genomes the representative gene ontology go terms for these genes were stress response and development both through a change in protein modification or signaling rather than by enhancing signal recognition in retention patterns analysis 98 of b rapa genes were retained as collinear gene pairs 77 of those were singlyretained in recent or young genomes resulting from death of the ancestral copies while others were multiretained as long retention genes go enrichments indicated that single retention genes mainly function in the interpretation of genetic information whereas multiretention genes were biased toward signal response especially regarding development and defense in the recent genome 13302 5790 and 20 gene pairs were multiretained following brassica whole genome triplication wgt events with 2 3 and 4 homoeologous copies respectively enriched goslim terms from b rapa homomoelogues imply that a major effect of the b rapa wgt may have been to acquire environmental adaptability or to change the course of development these homoeologues seem to more frequently undergo subfunctionalization with spatial expression patterns compared with other possible events including nonfunctionalization and neofunctionalizationconclusion we refined brassicaceae gb information using the latest genomic resources and distinguished three chronologically ordered b rapa genomes b rapa genes were categorized into fast evolving single and multiretention genes and long retention genes by their substitution rates and retention patterns representative functions of the categorized genes were elucidated providing better understanding of b rapa evolution and the brassica genus © 2014 kim et al species hybrids have long been undervalued in conservation and are often perceived as a threat to pure species recently the conservation value of hybrids especially those of natural origin has gained recognition however hybrid conservation remains controversial we reviewed hybrid management policies including laws regulations and management protocols from a variety of organizations primarily in canada and the united states we found that many policies are based on limited ethical and ecological considerations and provide little opportunity for hybrid conservation in most policies hybrids are either unrepresented or considered a threat to conservation goals this is problematic because our review of the hybrid conservation literature identified many ethical and ecological considerations relevant to determining the conservation value of a hybrid all of which are managementcontext specific we also noted a lack of discussion of the ethical considerations regarding hybrid conservation based on these findings we created a policy framework outlining situations in which hybrids could be eligible for conservation in canada and the united states the framework comprises a decision tree that helps users determine whether a hybrid should be eligible for conservation based on multiple ecological and ethical considerations the framework may be applied to any hybrid and is flexible in that it accommodates contextspecific management by allowing different options if a hybrid is a threat to or could benefit conservation goals the framework can inform policy makers and conservationists in decisionmaking processes regarding hybrid conservation by providing a systematic set of decision criteria and guidance on additional criteria to be considered in cases of uncertainty and it fills a policy gap that limits current hybrid management © 2015 society for conservation biology background the campanuloideae campanulaceae are a highly diverse clade of angiosperms found mostly in the northern hemisphere with the highest diversity in temperate areas of the old world chloroplast markers have greatly improved our understanding of this clade but many relationships remain unclear primarily due to low levels of molecular evolution and recent and rapid divergence furthermore focusing solely on maternally inherited markers such as those from the chloroplast genome may obscure processes such as hybridization in this study we explore the phylogenetic utility of two lowcopy nuclear loci from the pentatricopeptide repeat gene family ppr rapidly evolving nuclear loci may provide increased phylogenetic resolution in clades containing recently diverged or closely related taxa we present results based on both chloroplast and lowcopy nuclear loci and discuss the utility of such markers to resolve evolutionary relationships and infer hybridization events within the campanuloideae clade results the inclusion of lowcopy nuclear genes into the analyses provides increased phylogenetic resolution in two speciesrich clades containing recently diverged taxa we also obtain support for the placement of two early diverging lineages jasione and musschiagadellia clades that have previously been unresolved furthermore phylogenetic analyses of ppr loci revealed potential hybridization events for a number of taxa eg campanula pelviformis and legousia species these loci offer greater overall topological support than obtained with plastid dna alone conclusion this study represents the first inclusion of lowcopy nuclear genes for phylogenetic reconstruction in campanuloideae the two ppr loci were easy to sequence required no cloning and the sequence alignments were straightforward across the entire campanuloideae clade although potentially complicated by incomplete lineage sorting these markers proved useful for understanding the processes of reticulate evolution and resolving relationships at a wide range of phylogenetic levels our results stress the importance of including multiple independent loci in phylogenetic analyses © 2014 crowl et al anthropogenic activity is driving population declines and extinctions of largebodied fruiteating animals worldwide loss of these frugivores is expected to trigger negative cascading effects on plant populations if remnant species fail to replace the seed dispersal services provided by the extinct frugivores a collapse of seed dispersal may not only affect plant demography ie lack of recruitment but should also supress gene flow via seed dispersal yet little empirical data still exist demonstrating the genetic consequences of defaunation for animaldispersed plant species here we first document a significant reduction of seed dispersal distances along a gradient of humandriven defaunation with increasing loss of large and mediumbodied frugivores we then show that local plant neighbourhoods have higher genetic similarity and smaller effective population sizes when large seed dispersers become extinct ie only small frugivores remain or are even partially downgraded ie mediumsized frugivores providing less efficient seed dispersal our results demonstrate that preservation of large frugivores is crucial to maintain functional seed dispersal services and their associated genetic imprints a central conservation target early signals of reduced dispersal distances that accompany the anthropogenic defaunation forecast multiple cascading effects on plant populations human alteration of islands has made restoration a key part of conservation management as islands are restored to their original state species interactions change and some populations may be impacted in this study we examine the coxella weevil hadramphus spinipennis broun and its hostplant dieffenbachs speargrass aciphylla dieffenbachii kirk which are both open habitat specialists with populations on mangere and rangatira islands chathams new zealand both of these islands were heavily impacted by the introduction of livestock the majority of the forest was removed and the weevil populations declined due to the palatability of their hostplant to livestock an intensive reforestation program was established on both islands over 50 years ago but the potential impacts of this restoration project on the already endangered h spinipennis are poorly understood we combined genetic and population data from 1995 and 20102011 to determine the health and status of these species on both islands there was some genetic variation between the weevil populations on each island but little variation within the species as a whole the interactions between the weevil and its hostplant populations appear to remain intact onmangere despite forest regeneration a decline in weevils and hostplant on rangatira does not appear to be caused by canopy regrowth we recommend that 1 these populations be monitored for ongoing effects of longterm reforestation 2 the cause of the decline on rangatira be investigated and 3 the two populations of weevils be conserved as separate evolutionarily significant units © 2015 fountain et al paliurus

hungary genetic diversity of wheat landraces constituted a sizable portion of the mega diversity in the fertile crescent as a center of origin and of diversity of major crop plants following wheat domestication in the fertile crescent early farmers developed diverse wheat landraces and contributed to their evolution enrichment onfarm conservation and developed efficient seed exchange systems and ensured the continued evolution and diversification of these landraces for millennia wheat landraces served as staples for food production in the fertile crescent and beyond however their use dramatically declined in the 2nd half of the last century and they were replaced by modern highyielding cultivars wheat landraces are facing the risk of genetic pollution and genetic erosion and extinction due to anthropogenic and natural causes including climate change monitoring and reversing genetic erosion in wheat landraces are scientifically challenging technically and logistically difficult and require longterm dedication and extensive efforts of farmers and the public sector this paper presents indepth assessment of the status of the vanishing wheat landraces of the fertile

genetic diversity within and among 8 natural populations and 1 cultivar from northern tunisia a total of 181 polymorphic intersimple sequence repeat markers were generated using 7 primers shannon’s index and analysis of molecular variance evidenced a high molecular polymorphism at intraspecific levels for wild and cultivated accessions showing that tunisian tall fescue germplasm constitutes an important pool of diversity withinpopulation variation accounted for 3942 of the total variation but no regional differentiation was discernible to designate close relationships between regions most of the variation ginfstinf  67 occurred between populations rather than within populations the ɸinfstinf 060 revealed high population structuring additionally the population structure was independent of the geographic origin and was not affected by environmental factors the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean tree based on genetic similarity and principal coordinate analysis based on coefficient similarity illustrated that continental populations from the proximate localities of beja and jendouba were genetically closely related while the wild skalba population from the littoral tunisian locality was the most diverse from the others moreover great molecular similarity of the spontaneous population sedjnane originated from the mountain areas was revealed with the local

earth is seawater each kilogram of which contains about 35 g of salts and yet most plants cannot grow in this solution less than 02  of species can develop and reproduce with repeated exposure to seawater these extremophiles are called halophytes scope improved knowledge of halophytes is of importance to understanding our natural world and to enable the use of some of these fascinating plants in land revegetation as forages for livestock and to develop salttolerant crops in this preface to a special issue on halophytes and saline adaptations the evolution of salt tolerance in halophytes their lifehistory traits and progress in understanding the molecular biochemical and physiological mechanisms contributing to salt tolerance are summarized in particular cellular processes that underpin the ability of halophytes to tolerate high tissue concentrations of na and cl including regulation of membrane transport their ability to synthesize compatible solutes and to deal with reactive oxygen species are highlighted interacting stress factors in addition to salinity such as heavy metals and flooding are also topics gaining increased attention in the search to understand the biology of halophytes conclusions halophytes will play increasingly important roles as models for understanding plant salt tolerance as genetic resources contributing towards the goal of improvement

these threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance but ultimately ecosystem functions and services thus seed dispersers such as the strawcoloured fruit bat e helvum which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species using highresolution gpstracking of movements field observations and gut retention experiments we quantify dispersal distances for small and largeseeded fruits foraged by e helvum during periods of colony population low wet season and high dry season in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of ghana gut passage time averaged 116 min range 41143 min comparable to other fruit bats movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season as the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts median dispersal distances were similar for both large 4267 m and small 4265 m seeds however small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 754 km four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similarsized frugivore maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural 497 km compare to the urban 312 km landscape within the urban landscape estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season 754 km compared to the wet season 228 km in contrast distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season 67 km compared to the dry season 244 dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season 551 m in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season 319 m we found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances the maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts mean distance from food tree 263 m was 47 small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances 500 and 1000 m with a likelihood of 30  and 23  respectively our data show that e helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical africa we suggest e helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation © 2016 the authors human activity and land use changes in the past decades have led to landscape homogenization and smallscale fragmentation of grassland habitats in most regions of central europe as a result populations of many grassland species are small and strongly fragmented facing extinction due to genetic depauperation and local maladaptation in remnant habitats in this study remaining populations of the strongly endangered grassland species dianthus seguieri ssp glaber “ragged pink” in bavaria were investigated in order to evaluate the environmental factors influencing its genetic variation and performance we first evaluated habitat vegetation and population structure species performance was then studied by assessing the number of generative shoots flowers and fertile capsules and evaluating seed weight and seed viability finally genetic variation was analyzed using molecular markers aflps our analyses revealed that population size and land use abandonment have the strongest impact on genetic variation and species’ performance large and extended

height and coverage and a high proportion of gramineous species resulting from the lack of land use reduced genetic variation effective fruit and seed set our study shows that both population size and land use abandonment need to be considered to ensure the long term protection of endangered plant species maintaining an open habitat structure and adequate soil nutrient conditions through targeted

springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht our objective was to examine the genetic diversity of central and peripheral populations of toona ciliata var pubescens to elucidate whether the centralperipheral hypothesis applies to these populations we analyzed 392 individuals from nine natural populations using eight pairs of polymorphic ssr primers the results showed that the mean numbers of observed and expected alleles in peripheral populations were higher than in central populations common widespread and rare local rl alleles were observed in all populations however common local alleles were found in five populations and rare widespread alleles were only found in three the total numbers of the four types of alleles were higher in peripheral than in central populations and the quantity of the rl allele was obviously higher in the peripheral populations than in the central populations both the observed and expected heterozygosities were higher in peripheral populations compared with the central populations the coefficient of gene differentiation of the peripheral populations was 03045 which was significantly higher than that of the centralpopulations the gene flow between central populations was greater than one but less than one between peripheral populations this indicates that frequent gene flow exists between central populations while terrain and habitat fragmentation prevent gene flow between peripheral populations a mantel test indicated that there was no relationship between genetic and geographical distance of t ciliata var pubescens ©

consequence of the global uptake of new highyielding green revolution agricultural varieties plant breeders and scientists advocated a strategy of freezing and longterm storage of seed which enabled the salvage of genetic diversity for future users without requiring the continual cultivation of old varieties seed banking could preserve valuable genetic material and enable agricultural

will depend on effective propagule flow across the landscape we analyze functional connectivity in a holm oak quercus ilex fragmented landscape by considering three important stages driving recruitment effective pollination acorn production and acorn dispersal we used a network approach to 1 determine if pollenmediated gene exchange across the landscape was spatially structured 2 estimate the effects of limited acorn dispersal on functional connectivity 3 identify which landscape traits could drive sourcesink dynamics of gene flow although long distance dispersal was relatively frequent most effective pollen flow occurred over short distances 100 m this resulted in a significantly modular structure of the mating network yielding higher gene flow among nearby fragments limited mouse acorn hoarding activity had a strong impact on landscape connectivity decreasing male gametic immigration rates into forest patches by one order of magnitude besides our results show that big forest fragments 10 ha are the main pollen sources while small ones 1 ha are important pollen sinks thus big fragments are critical to maintain functional connectivity while small forest fragments may provide acorn crops better representing regional genetic diversity in addition to area effects less isolated and more central fragments showed higher migration rates and exchanged effective pollen with more fragments hence we expected that landscapes with uniform or clumped distribution of big forest fragments would show optimal connectivity traits however despite that simulated gene flow was more evenly distributed across the landscape connectance and migration rates decreased our results call for caution before translating patchlevel management guidelines to the landscape scale they also show that the level of functional connectivity may change throughout the recruitment process suggesting that largescale conservation strategies may fail if local

conventional storage protocols have been developed to preserve genetic diversity of seeds of crops in genebanks these same principles have been applied to preserve seeds from wild populations while most principles for conventional storage protocols are applicable to a broad range of wild species seeds from wild populations are not amenable to some practices that assume high uniformity within the seed lot small sample sizes and high heterogeneity of seeds from wild populations demand greater a priori knowledge of characteristic longevity as well as new tools to monitor viability without germinating seeds some of the challenges handling seeds from undomesticated plants are exemplified from an experiment with sagebrush artemisia tridentata seeds sagebrush seeds deteriorate very quickly at high humidity and moderately fast at room temperature rapid drying of seeds and immediate placement in the freezer might boost longevity as with seeds from most wild species there is insufficient

data of dna sequences two maternally inherited intergenic spacers of chloroplast cpdna and one biparentally inherited internal transcribed spacer region its4its5 nrdna and sixteen microsatellite loci ssr were conducted in the species of the 118 samples 86 individuals from the seven populations were used for dna sequencing and 115 individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study we found high genetic diversity at the species level low genetic diversity within each of the seven populations and high genetic differentiation among the populations there was a clear genetic structure within populations of c simplicipinna a demographic history inferred from dna sequencing data indicates that c simplicipinna experienced a recent population contraction without retreating to a common refugium during the last glacial period the results derived from ssr data also showed that c simplicipinna underwent past effective population contraction likely during the pleistoceneconclusions some genetic features of c simplicipinna such as having high genetic differentiation among the populations a clear genetic structure and a recent population contraction could provide guidelines for protecting this endangered species from extinction furthermore the genetic features with population dynamics of the species in our study would help provide insights and

numerous and varied and they are known to play fundamental roles in angiosperm plant growth and development two closely related peptide signalling molecule families are the clavata3embryosurrounding region cle and clelike clel genes which encode precursors of secreted peptide ligands that have roles in meristem maintenance and root gravitropism progress in peptide signalling molecule research in gymnosperms has lagged behind that of angiosperms we therefore sought to identify cle and clel genes in gymnosperms and conduct a comparative analysis of these gene families with angiospermsresults we undertook a metaanalysis of the genbankemblddbj gymnosperm est database and the picea abies and p glauca genomes and identified 93 putative cle genes and 11 clel genes among eight pinophyta species in the genera cryptomeria pinus and picea the predicted conifer cle and clel protein sequences had close phylogenetic relationships with their homologues in arabidopsis notably perfect conservation of

eight conifer species we cloned the pinus radiata cle4144tdif orthologues these genes were preferentially expressed in phloem in planta as expected but unexpectedly also in differentiating tracheary element te cultures surprisingly transcript abundances of these te differentiationinhibitors sharply increased during early te differentiation suggesting that some cells differentiate into phloem cells in addition to tes in these cultures applied cle13 and cle4144 peptides inhibited root elongation in pinus radiata seedlings we show evidence that two clel genes are alternatively spliced via 3terminal acceptor exons encoding separate clel peptidesconclusions the cle and clel genes are found in conifers and they exhibit at least as much sequence diversity in these species as they do in other plant species only one cle peptide sequence has been 100 conserved between gymnosperms and angiosperms over 300 million years of evolutionary history the cle4144tdif peptide and its likely conifer orthologues the preferential expression of these vascular developmentregulating genes in phloem in conifers as they are in dicot species suggests close parallels in the regulation of secondary growth and wood formation in gymnosperm and dicot plants based on our bioinformatic analysis we predict a novel mechanism of regulation of the expression of several conifer clel peptides via

populations of a shrub of evergreen broadleaved forest loropetalum chinense from the artificially created thousandisland lake til and the holocenedated zhoushan archipelago of southeast china populations from the til region harboured higher levels of genetic diversity than those from the zhoushan archipelago but these differences were not significant there was no correlation between genetic diversity and most island features excepting a negative effect of mainlandisland distance on allelic richness and expected heterozygosity in the zhoushan archipelago in general levels of gene flow among island populations were moderate to high and tests of alternative models of population history strongly favoured a gene flowdrift model over a pure drift model in each region in sum our results showed no obvious genetic effects of habitat fragmentation due to recent artificial or past natural island formation rather they highlight the importance of gene flow most likely via seed in

aflp markers relatively low genetic diversity values were observed increasing in the following order l aculeata  l serriola  l saligna network analysis clearly separated samples according to their taxonomic determination also reflecting the gene diversity as well as the genetic distance values among the three species nevertheless given the predominantly selfing character of these species populations were not uniform genetically and morphologically it seems that overall genetic variation in a population increases at its periphery due to the presence of plants with “nonindigenous” alleles which are most likely coming from migration and subsequent interpopulation or interspecific hybridization mantel tests generally indicated a positive association between genetic distance and microgeographical distance of a particular population primarily due to the “outlier” samples collected at a population’s periphery © 2014 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht cacao is widespread

native range and a globally important germplasm resource for ornamental rose breeding after introduction into europe as a hardy resistant garden rose in the 18th century r rugosa escaped and invaded many countries around the north sea and the baltic sea as well as sandy coasts of north america however wild r rugosa populations in china have decreased continuously over the past three decades consequentially the species is considered rare and endangered in china and is listed in the china plant red data book a large number of studies have focused on the expanding r rugosa populations in northwestern europe and the shrinking populations in china to identify future research directions a comprehensive overview of the literature is crucial to gain insight into linkages and gaps among different studies in this review we analyze previous studies on the population biology of r rugosa to clarify the ecological characteristics and changes of its distribution range in china in addition we discuss the potential factors driving the decrease of the native populations in china overall r rugosa populations in china suffer from reduced reproduction poor seed quality eroded genetic diversity due to genetic drift and strong pressures from habitat loss and anthropogenic disturbances the fenced enclosure of protected areas that has preserved existing shrubs has also stimulated the facilitated succession of plant communities and overgrowth of some tall grass species external habitat degradation and internal genetic erosion may be contributing to the population decrease in china according to research on invasive r rugosa populations in northwestern europe the species is disturbancefavored and has expanded very quickly in its invasive range it frequently forms large dense and continuous monodominant shrub zones that exclude native species and plant communities from the north sea and the baltic sea dunes and sandy beaches most of the invasive populations exhibit increased seed reproduction mixture of multiple varieties release from herbivory and parasitism we infer that the evolved high adaptation of r rugosa to novel environments resistance to pathogens in its introduced range and inappropriate anthropogenic disturbances are the main factors driving its invasion success after comparing differences between endangered and invasive populations of r rugosa we propose that future research should focus on the following aspects 1 comparative research on quantitative dynamics and genetic structure of endangered and invasive r rugosa populations 2 dynamic monitoring of natural r rugosa populations and individual shrubs in its native and invasive ranges 3 examining the differences of functional genes and genomics among r rugosa populations and individual shrubs therefore to discover specific genes or genotypes related to population invasiveness andor depression and 4 designing control or conservation strategies based on population biology

and often extreme habitats apart from oxygenic photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation wellstudied processes from chloroplasts and mitochondria of plants and animals prokaryotes utilize various chemo or lithotrophic modes such as anoxygenic photosynthesis iron oxidation and reduction sulfate reduction and methanogenesis most bioenergetic pathways have a similar general structure with an electron transport chain composed of protein complexes acting as electron donors and acceptors as well as a central cytochrome complex mobile electron carriers and an atp synthase while each pathway has been studied in considerable detail in isolation not much is known about their relative evolutionary relationships wanting to address how this metabolic diversity evolved we mapped the distribution of nine bioenergetic modes on a phylogenetic tree based on 16s rrna sequences from 272 species representing the full diversity of prokaryotic lineages this highlights the patchy distribution of many pathways across different lineages and suggests either up to 26 independent origins or 17 horizontal gene transfer events next we used comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of all subunits of the f0f1 atp synthase common to most bacterial lineages regardless of their bioenergetic mode our results indicate an ancient origin of this protein complex and no clustering based on bioenergetic mode which suggests that no special modifications are needed for the atp synthase to work with different electron transport chains moreover examination of the atp synthase genetic locus indicates various gene rearrangements in the different bacterial lineages ancient duplications of atpi and of the beta subunit of the f0 subcomplex as well as more recent stochastic lineagespecific and speciesspecific duplications of all subunits we discuss the implications of the overall pattern of conservation and flexibility of the f0f1 atp synthase genetic locus © 2014 koumandou kossida we examined the local adaptation patterns in a system comprising several interconnected heterogeneous plant populations from which populations of two phylogenetically closely related pathogens were also sampled the host is hordeum vulgare cultivated barley the pathogens are pyrenophora teres f teres net form and pyrenophora teres f maculata spot form the causal agents of barley net blotch we integrated two approaches the comparison between the population structures of the host and the pathogens and a crossinoculation test we demonstrated that two closely related pathogens with very similar niche specialisation and lifestyles can give rise to different coevolutionary outcomes on the same host indeed we detected local adaptation for the net form of the pathogen but not for the spot form we also provided evidence that an apriori wellknown resistance quantitativetraitlocus on barley chromosome 6h is involved in the coevolutionary arms race between the plant and the netform pathogen moreover data suggested latitudinal clines of host resistance and that different ecological conditions can result in differential selective pressures at different sites our data are of interest for onfarm conservation of plant genetic resources as also in establishing efficient breeding programs and strategies for deployment of resistance genes of p teres salvia desoleana is a herbaceous perennial shrub endemic of sardinia italy the leaves are a source of essential oil used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries the therapeutic function of this species has been associated to the presence of essential oils rich in αβpinene pcimene linalool linalyl acetate and 18cineole today the industrial request of salvia essential oils is increasing and most of the biomass is exploited from the natural populations which are under severe risk of genetic erosion in order to improve the essential oil production the study of the environmental parameters that influence composition quality and quantity of the essential oils turns out to be necessary soil physical and chemical structure represents one of the determinant factors in secondary metabolites production and could also be involved in volatiles fraction composition in the same species the main aim of this research was to explore the relationship between essential oil profiles and soil characteristics in s desoleana populations gcms analysis performed on the essential oil extracts identified 22 principal compounds which were extremely variable among the five s desoleana populations studied the analysis of the essential oils revealed different compositions in the terpenes fractions 682 of monoterpenes 273 of sesquiterpenes and 45 of diterpenes analysis of chemical and physical soil parameters at the collection sites revealed that silt and sand contents were correlated with αpinene and sclareol fractions and the total k2o was significantly correlated to several compounds

pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen with a high incidence of hospital infections that represents a threat to immune compromised patients genomic studies have shown that in contrast to other pathogenic bacteria clinical and environmental isolates do not show particular genomic differences in addition genetic variability of all the p aeruginosa strains whose genomes have been sequenced is extremely low this low genomic variability might be explained if clinical strains constitute a subpopulation of this bacterial species present in environments that are close to human populations which preferentially produce virulence associated traitsresults in this work we sequenced the genomes and performed phenotypic descriptions for four nonhuman p aeruginosa isolates collected from a plant the ocean a waterspring and from dolphin stomach we show that the four strains are phenotypically diverse and that this is not reflected in genomic variability since their genomes are almost identical furthermore we performed a detailed comparative genomic analysis of the four strains studied in this work with the thirteen previously reported p aeruginosa genomes by means of describing their core and pangenomesconclusions contrary to what has been described for other bacteria we have found that the p aeruginosa core genome is constituted by a high proportion of genes and that its pangenome is thus relatively small considering the high degree of genomic conservation between isolates of p aeruginosa from diverse environments including human tissues some implications for the treatment of infections are discussed this work also represents a methodological contribution for the genomic study of p aeruginosa since we provide a database of the comparison

and marine species in the southeastern united states revealed that phylogenetically diverse taxa share a phylogeographic break at the southern tip of florida the maritime discontinuity these studies have focused nearly exclusively on animals few coastal plant species in florida have been analyzed phylogeographically we investigated phylogeographic patterns of black mangroves avicennia germinans and red mangroves rhizophora mangle two coastal trees that occur on both coasts of the peninsula of florida methods we sampled and genotyped 150 individuals each of a germinans and r mangle using eight microsatellite loci per species we used observed and expected heterozygosity to quantify genetic diversity in each sampling location and allele frequencies to identify putative phylogeographic breaks and measure gene flow using bayesass and migraten we tested the hypothesis that both species would exhibit a phylogeographic break at the southern tip of florida key results we did not find any significant phylogeographic breaks in either species rhizophora mangle exhibits greater genetic structure than a germinans contrary to expectations based on propagule dispersal capability however directional gene flow from the gulf to the atlantic was more pronounced in r mangle indicating that the gulf stream may affect genetic patterns in r mangle more than in a germinans conclusions the high dispersal capability of these species may lead to high genetic connectivity between sampling locations and little geographic structure we also identified several locations that based on genetic

populations however interpretations of am as a purely precautionary action along with multiple definitions have hampered the development of precise policy frameworks here our main objective is to identify what type of policy tools are needed for implementing am programs as part of broader environmental policies first we argue that policy frameworks for translocations of endangered species that are subject to climatic stress are fundamentally different from translocations to reinforce climatically exposed ecosystems because the former are risky and stranded in strict regulations while the latter are open to merges with general landscape management am implementation can be based on a series of phases where policies should provide appropriate grounds closely related to extant environmental principles during a triggering phase am is clearly a prevention approach as considered by the rio declaration if unambiguously based on evidence that population decline is mainly caused by climate change during an operational phase we suggest that policies should enforce experimentation and be explicit on transparent coordination approaches for collating all available knowledge and ensure multiactor participation prior to any large scale am program in addition precautionary approaches are needed to minimize risks of translocation failures maladaptation that can be reduced through redundancy of multiple target sites lastly monitoring and learning policies during an adaptive phase would promote using flexible management rules to react and adjust to any early alerts positive or negative as hybridization with local individuals may represent an evolutionary chance our analysis of study cases indicates that except for two programs of productive forests in canada current am programs are predominantly smallscale experimental and applied to endangered species isolated from general environmental management as the effects of climate change accumulate policies

environmental feature that affects the spatial genetic structures of plant species however its influence on such structures at small spatial scales has hardly been investigated for forest tree species even though many of them are located in mountains with complex topographic features here we report the genetic structures of a pioneer species castanopsis chinensis fagaceae in a 20ha forest plot in dinghushan in lower subtropical china which has complex topographic features such as valleys and ridges c chinensis typically undergoes wind pollination but its seeds are dispersed by gravity and animals therefore the mechanisms of transportation of its seeds may result in topographydependent genetic structures whereas windmediated pollen flow of c chinensis may reduce such structures through counteracting the influence of topography our results indicate that most of the genetic patterns in c chinensis in our study plot were attributable to windmediated pollen flow however we also found both seed and pollen flows could be impeded by ridges causing some varied genetic patterns even between locations separated by only small distances we observed that owing to topographic positions where they grew the 13 old individuals that were probably the oldest in the southeast corner of the plot had not made major genetic contributions to the young individuals that had recently colonised

subfamilies in the western tarnished plant bug lygus hesperus a polyphagous agricultural pest phylogenetic analyses revealed clear orthologous relationships with abc transporters linked to insecticidexenobiotic clearance and indicated lineage specific expansion of the l hesperus abcg and abch subfamilies the transcriptional profile of 13 lhabcs representative of the abca abcb abcc abcg

Â© 2014 qian et al aim metacommunity structure is a function of both local sitespecific and regional landscapelevel ecological factors and the relative importance of each may be mediated by the dispersal ability of organisms here we used aquatic invertebrate communities to investigate the relationship between local and regional factors in explaining distance decay relationships ddrs in fragmented dendritic stream networks location dryland streams distributed within a 400km2 section of the san pedro river basin southeastern arizona usa methods we combined finescale local information flow and habitat characteristics with regionalscale information to explain ddr patterns in community composition of aquatic invertebrate species with a wide range of dispersal abilities we used a novel application of a landscape resistance modelling approach originally developed for landscape genetic studies that simultaneously assessed the importance of local and regional ecological factors as well as dispersal ability of organisms results we found evidence that both local and regional factors influenced aquatic invertebrate ddrs in dryland stream networks and the importance of each factor depended on the dispersal capacities of the organisms local and weak dispersers were more affected by sitespecific factors intermediate dispersers by landscapelevel factors and strong dispersers showed no discernable pattern this resulted in a strongly humpshaped relationship between dispersal ability and landscapelevel factors where only moderate dispersers showed evidence of ddrs unlike most other studies of dendritic networks our results suggest that overland pathways using perennial refugia as steppingstones might be the main dispersal route in fragmented stream networks main conclusions we suggest that using a combination of landscape and local distance measures can help to unravel metacommunity patterns in dendritic systems our findings have important conservation implications such as the need to manage river systems for organisms that span a wide variety of dispersal abilities and local ecological requirements our results also highlight the need to preserve perennial refugia in fragmented networks as they may ensure the viability of aquatic metacommunities by facilitating dispersal © 2015 john wiley  sons ltd there is an urgent need for novel agronomic

rotation systems we review the literature and propose criteria for the design of crop rotations focusing on the roles of soil biota and feedback on crop productivity and soil health we consider that identifying specific key organisms or consortia capable of influencing plant productivity is more important as a predictor of soil health and crop productivity than assessing the overall soil

diversity and population differentiation of this species have not been studied t yunnanensis is an ancient treeshrub mainly distributed in southwest china recently the species has suffered a sharp

fragmentation of this endangered species using 11 polymorphic microsatellites we genotyped 288 individuals from 14 populations from a rangewide sampling in china our results suggest that two different population groups that were once isolated have persisted in situ during glacial periods in both areas and have not merged since habitat fragmentation has led to significant genetic bottlenecks high inbreeding and population divergence in this species the two different population groups of t yunnanensis could be attributed to restricted gene flow caused through isolation by geographical barriers and by habitat heterogeneity during uplift of the qtp or the existence of two separate glacial refugia during the pleistocene in situ and ex situ conservation of the two evolutionarily significant

nextgeneration sequencing and computational and experimental analyses we profiled and characterized sncrna species and mrna genes from the plants that experienced severe and moderate chilling stresses that underwent further severe chilling stress after chilling acclimation at moderate stress and that grew under the normal condition we also included castor bean ricinus communis in our study to

stress acclimation in euphorbiaceous plants the genomic integrity of every organism is constantly challenged by endogenous and exogenous dnadamaging factors mutagenic agents cause reduced stability of plant genome and have a deleterious effect on development and in the case of crop species lead to yield reduction it is crucial for all organisms including plants to develop efficient mechanisms for maintenance of the genome integrity dna repair processes have been characterized in bacterial fungal and mammalian model systems the description of these processes in plants in contrast was initiated relatively recently and has been focused largely on the model plant arabidopsis thaliana consequently our knowledge about dna repair in plant genomes  particularly in the genomes of crop plants  is by far more limited however the relatively small size of the arabidopsis genome its rapid life cycle and availability of various transformation methods make this species an attractive model for the study of eukaryotic dna repair mechanisms and mutagenesis moreover abnormalities in dna repair which proved to be lethal for animal models are tolerated in plant genomes although sensitivity to dna damaging agents is retained due to the high conservation of dna repair processes and factors mediating them among eukaryotes genes and proteins that have been identified in model species may serve to identify homologous sequences in other species including crop plants in which these mechanisms are poorly understood crop breeding programs have provided remarkable advances in food quality and yield over the last century although the human population is predicted to “peak” by 2050 further advances in yield will be required to feed this population breeding requires genetic diversity the biological impact of any mutagenic agent used for the creation of genetic diversity depends on the chemical nature of the induced lesions and on the efficiency and accuracy of their repair more recent targeted mutagenesis procedures also depend on host repair processes with different pathways yielding different products enhanced understanding of dna repair processes in plants will inform and accelerate the

necessary in a diverse sca population however sampling 125 scl or 60 sca individuals was necessary to capture 90  of all the alleles present these findings indicate that theoretical guidelines for ex

harvesting pressure remain largely unknown we conducted genetic and demographic studies of nothapodytes nimmoniana graham one of the extensively harvested medicinal plant species in the western ghats biodiversity hotspot india to assess the effectiveness of protected areas in longterm maintenance of economically important plant species methodologyprincipal findings the analysis of adults and seedlings of n nimmoniana in four protected and four nonprotected areas using 7 nuclear microsatellite loci revealed that populations that are distributed within protected areas are subject to lower levels of harvesting and maintain higher genetic diversity he0816 ho0607 a18857 than populations in adjoining nonprotected areas he0781 ho0511 a15571 furthermore seedlings in protected areas had significantly higher observed heterozygosity ho0630 and private alleles as compared to seedlings in adjoining nonprotected areas ho0426 most populations revealed signatures of recent genetic bottleneck the prediction of longterm maintenance of genetic diversity using bottlesim indicated that current population sizes of the species are not sufficient to maintain 90 of present genetic

characterization of translocations having taken place within its native range microsatellite variation at 13 nuclear loci and sequence data of two mitochondrial dna fragments were analyzed on the basis of a comprehensive rangewide population sample two complementary methods geneclass and structure were used to infer translocation events based on nuclear data whereas mitochondrial data were used for validation of these inferences using geneclass we found translocation events in a majority of populations additional cases of translocation and many instances of admixture were identified using structure thanks to the clearcut ancestral genetic structure detected in this species in particular a strong divide between alpine and central european populations also apparent at mitochondrial markers helped uncover details on translocation events and related processes translocations and associated admixture events were found to be heterogeneously distributed across the species range with a particularly high frequency in central europe furthermore translocations frequently involved multiple geographic sources some of which were overrepresented our study illustrates the importance of rangewide investigations for tracing translocations back to their origins and for revealing some of their consequences it provides some first clues for developing suitable conservation and management

decoded and transmitted to downstream responses by an elaborate toolkit of ca2 binding proteins that function as ca2 sensorsin this article we examine the distribution and evolution of ca2conducting channels and ca2 decoding proteins in the plant lineage to this end we have in addition to previously studied genomes of plant species identified and analyzed the ca2signaling components from species that hold key evolutionary positions like the filamentous terrestrial algae klebsormidium flaccidum and amborella trichopoda the single living representative of the sister lineage to all other extant flowering plantsplants and animals exhibit substantial differences in their complements of ca2 channels and ca2 binding proteins within the plant lineage remarkable differences in the evolution of complexity between different families of ca2 signaling proteins are observable using the cblcipk ca2 sensorkinase signaling network as model we attempt to link evolutionary tendencies to functional predictions our analyses for example suggest ca2 dependent regulation of na homeostasis as an evolutionary most ancient function of this signaling network overall gene families of ca2 signaling proteins have significantly increased in their size during plant evolution reaching an extraordinary complexity in angiosperms © 2014 elsevier ltd agricultural biodiversity is a key part of the ecosystem biodiversity but it receives little concern the monoculture environmental pollution and habitat fragmentation caused by agricultural activities have threatened agricultural biodiversity over the past 50 years to optimize agricultural management measures for crop production and environmental protection we reviewed the effects of agricultural activities including cultivation patterns plastic mulching chemical additions and the cultivation of transgenic crops on agricultural biodiversity the results showed that chemical pesticides and fertilizers had the most serious influence and the effects of transgenic crops varied with other factors like the specific transgene inserted in crops the environmental risk of transgenic crops should be assessed widely through casebycase methods

a wide host range that includes cultivated and uncultivated species forest fruit trees and weeds dp isolates are hemibiotrophs and have different sources of primary inoculum as stubble and seeds to restart cycles of parasitism  saprophytism they colonize host tissues from early plant stages and establish different nutritional relationships acting as endophytic and necrotrophic fungi the plasticity of the phomopsis genus has favored its expansion to different agroecosystems and various hosts constituting an epidemiological risk the objective was to validate the identity and evaluate the biological relationships among 12 isolates of p longicolla and d phaseolorum var sojae anamorph p phaseoli var sojae obtained in different tempered and subtropical agroenvironments of argentina in order to analyze the variability and strategies for preserving fungal biodiversity macromorphological attributes such as texture and color of colonies stroma shape and distribution pycnidia and perythecia shape and distribution and micromorphological characteristics such as size and shape of conidia asci and ascospores allowed identifying three new isolates as p longicolla a complementary molecular analysis was also made to overcome the limitations derived from the morphological analysis thus the afp8413 isolate was finally identified as p longicolla the molecular characterization was useful to identify the evaluated isolates and to group them in four taxa of the diaporthephomopsis complex ten isolates were included in p longicolla one isolate was included in d phaseolorum var sojae anamorph p phaseoli var sojae one isolate was identified as d phaseolorum var caulivora and two isolates were included in d phaseolorum var meridionalis the use of phenotipic and molecular tools have contributed to an accurate identification of p longicolla and comprehension about the biological relationships homo or heterothallic hibridizations among d phaseolorum varieties p phaseoli and

pairwise fst estimates analyses of molecular variance amova principle component analysis pca and mantel tests were applied in a comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that occurs at various spatial scales in etenax structure analysis and pca results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation in contrast baps and geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but significant proportion of amongpopulations genetic variation revealed by amova similarly pairwise fst estimates partially argue against genetic homogeneity across europe the lack of correlation between genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that the flies disperse in multiple directions therefore our results indicate that continued longrange dispersal tend to homogenize populations over time resulting in little population structure in etenax across the european landmass on the other hand significant differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns in etenax might be geographically complex using information from our genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity across continent which is an important issue for conservation efforts since etenax is an important pollinator our results contribute to

evidence has demonstrated that cranberry phytochemicals may have potential benefits that promote healthy aging here we use caenorhabditis elegans as a model to show that watersoluble cranberry extract standardized to 40 proanthocyanidins wcesp a major component of cranberries can enhance host innate immunity to resist against vibrio cholerae v cholerae wild type c6706 o1 el tor biotype infection supplementation of wcesp did not significantly alter the intestinal colonization of v cholerae but upregulated the expression of c elegans innate immune genes such as clec46 clec71 fmo2 pqn5 and c23g101 additionally wcesp treatment did not affect the growth of v cholerae and expression of the major bacterial virulence genes and only slightly reduced bacterial colonization within c elegans intestine these findings indicate that the major components of wcesp including proanthocyanidins pacs may play an important role in enhancing the host innate immunity moreover we engaged c elegans mutants and identified that the p38 mapk signaling insulinigf1 signaling iis and hsf1 play pivotal roles in the wcespmediated host immune response considering the level of conservation between the innate immune pathways of c elegans and humans the results of this study suggest that wcesp may also play an immunitypromoting role in higher order organisms © 2014 dinh et al neglected and underutilized species nus are referred to as species with underexploited potentials with regard to food and nutrition security health income generation and environmental services in the past most breeding activities have concentrated on major crops leading to overdependence on a few plant species of worldwide economic importance the reasons for nus being underutilized are complex and entail economic and agroecological constraints as well as lack of knowledge awareness and supportive policies contextualization decentralization and collaboration are proposed as important design principles for breeding strategies focusing on nus four case studies illustrate how they are practically implemented in breeding programs two case studies focus on improving nus for adaptation to climate

population will affect both the area as well as the distribution of forest species and will emphasize the need for germplasm conservation many forest tree species especially conifers are characterized by long rotation times and regeneration intervals as well as by large size traditionally the conservation strategies of forest trees are based on in situ and ex situ conservation and as a complementary system cryopreservation is used as an additional or duplicate way of conserving germplasm the role of cryopreservation is especially prominent in connection with tree breeding programs

cryopreserved for a long time is reevaluated the free gas evolved in the pump chamber results in a low rod pump working efficiency and it can even lead to a failure a common and effective solution is to install a downhole gas separator before fluid entering the chamber which can divert the free gas to the annulus if we can reinject the diverted gas back to the tubing at a shallower depth above the pump the flowing gas is then recombined with the liquid and decreases fluid density consequently the injected gas also creates additional lifting drive for the liquid a new technology based on this concept has been developed and called casing gas assisted rod pumping cgarp this paper firstly presents an analytical model to optimize the overall lifting performance and minimize the operating expenditure it is especially useful in producing hydrocarbon at high goras the gas is recombined with the liquid above the pump installation depth the hydrostatic pressure gradient is reduced consequently however if the gas reinjection valve is placed at a shallow depth the well segment at reduced fluid density is subsequently short so the contribution of gas lift is restricted vice versa if the gas reinjection valve is placed at the depth close to the pump it requires high pressure to open the gas injection valve so the gas reinjection can happen infrequently and the production rate is unsfplease this paper has proposed a genetic optimization method to maximize the overall production system efficiency a multivariable vector has been defined which includes pumping speed and depth mechanical power rod string diameter and length surface stroke length downhole separator efficiency as well as gas reinjection valve depth the optimized object can be the system lifting efficiency or net present value which must be a function of this vector in the constraint of mass and momentum conservationsthis work has been applied as the primary guide for four oil producers with rod pump installed in jilin field china the average system lifting efficiency and production rate have been increased by 20 and 15 respectively this analytical model has enhanced the field performance most importantly the same concept can be applied for other pumpassisted wells © 2016 elsevier bv  marginal populations are expected to provide the frontiers for adaptation evolution and range shifts of

the knowledge of the genetic architecture of closely related species andor populations of a single species can be very useful to shed light on the processes that led to their current distributions the present study provides a preliminary evaluation of the conservation status of the populations of cryptotaenia thomasii a very narrow endemic species occurring in southern italy previous studies showed that c thomasii was phylogenetically closely related to c flahaultii endemic species of caucasus and to evaluate its conservation status and the genetic variability of plant species the internal transcribed spacers itss of nuclear ribosomal dna were sequenced and the snps were analyzed results the restriction analysis of nrdna with the restriction enzymes allowed to detect the presence of two

contact as an extreme case of geographical disjunction italiancaucasus conclusion from the evolutionary history of the species and its distribution pattern one can reconstruct a possible scenario with some hypotheses that explain the hypothetical ancestral area where the two species were in contact we speculate the two species may have originated from fragmentation of a common ancestor widespread in the western palearctic zone and have survived in two separated refuge areas limited by important mountain systems this hypothesis is supported by our molecular analysis in fact the analysis of snps

of 64 codons as and nonas genes are both under strong purifying selection but the former ones have significant lower mutation rate and are prone to be enriched towards the chromosomal ends in the group of as genes the variability in synonymous codon usage between genes is mainly due to the variations in gc content cds length as well as gene functions mutational bias that accounts for 2585  of the total codon usage variability plays a major role in shaping the codon usage pattern of as genes in contrast no obvious evidence is found for the contributions of translational selection as types

storage in general cold storage resulted in reduced somatic embryo germination and plant regeneration although 93 somatic embryo germination and 91 plant conversion were achieved regardless of the storage period cold storage led to cell browning and degradation additionally the cell structures were confirmed by the acetocarmine and evans blue dye evaluation collectively our results showed that embryogenic callus of k septemlobus could be preserved at 4°c without subculture for 6 months and suggested the need for storage of relatively more competent embryogenic calli lines to support somatic

suppression plant mob1 proteins display high sequence homology to animal mob1 proteins but little is known regarding their role in plant growth and development herein we report the critical roles of arabidopsis mob1 atmob1a in auxinmediated development in arabidopsis we found that lossoffunction mutations in atmob1a completely eliminated the formation of cotyledons when combined with mutations in pinoid pid which encodes a serthr protein kinase that participates in auxin signaling and transport we showed that atmob1a was fully rescued by its drosophila counterpart suggesting functional conservation the atmob1a pid double mutants phenocopied several wellcharacterized mutant combinations that are defective in auxin biosynthesis or transport moreover we demonstrated that atmob1a greatly enhanced several other known auxin mutants suggesting that atmob1a plays a key role in auxinmediated plant development the atmob1a single mutant displayed defects in early embryogenesis and had shorter root and smaller flowers than wild type plants atmob1a is uniformly expressed in embryos and suspensor cells during embryogenesis consistent with its role in embryo development atmob1a protein is localized to nucleus cytoplasm and associated to plasma membrane suggesting that it plays roles in these subcellular localizations furthermore we showed that disruption of atmob1a led to a reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin our results demonstrated that atmob1a plays an important role in arabidopsis development by promoting auxin signaling © 2016 cui et al natural disasters including drought and salt stress seriously threaten food security in previous work we cloned a key zinc finger transcription factor gene drought and salt tolerance dst a negative regulator of drought and salt tolerance that controls stomatal aperture in rice however the exact mechanism by which dst regulates the expression of target genes remains unknown in the present study we demonstrated that dst coactivator 1 dca1 a previously unknown chy zinc finger protein acts as an interacting coactivator of dst dst was found to physically interact with itself and to form a heterologous tetramer with dca1 this transcriptional complex appears to regulate the expression of peroxidase 24 precursor prx 24 a gene encoding an h2o2scavenger that is more highly expressed in guard cells downregulation of dca1 significantly enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice and overexpression of dca1 increased sensitivity to stress treatment these phenotypes were mainly influenced by dca1 and negatively regulated stomatal closure through the direct modulation of genes associated with h2o2homeostasis our findings establish a framework for plant drought and salt stress tolerance through the

there are two groups of germplasm the toxic and the nontoxic and most of the biofuels programs are based on toxic germplasm in the mountains of the totonacapan mexico nontoxic genotypes have been cultivated for human food from ancient times and now they are in serious risk of being lost because of the biofuel program as well as the ethnobotanical knowledge about this germplasm in the totonaca culture the starting hypothesis is that this ethnobotanical knowledge must be related with a high biodiversity of the germplasm of this crop which is necessary to preserve to avoid genetic erosion the objective of the work was to assess the biodiversity of the native germplasm using morphological traits and to analyse socioeconomic aspects related with the ethnobotany of this germplasm to design strategies for the conservation of the germplasm and of the culture linked to it other specific objective was to select morphological variables highly discriminant and easytomeasure for the characterization of this crop we selected eight morphological descriptors as the most discriminant related with the leaves length and width of the blade and length of the petiole and the fruit weight length diameter length of the peduncle and number of fruits per bunch on the basis of the principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis of the morphological data it was possible to identify as different germplasm pools the six locations sampled in spite of their proximity confirming the starting hypothesis that there is high biodiversity of this crop in the region the pools from camocuautla and tuzamapan were the most similar between them with small fruits and a low number of teeth in the leaves the germplasm form jonotla showed also small fruits but small leaves and a short petiole tetelillas germplasm showed a high number of teeth in the leaves big fruits and leaves and long petiole the accessions from ecatlán showed big fruits low number of fruits per bunch and short fruits peduncle with small leaves and a short petiole the differential traits of the accession from zozocolco were a high number of fruits per bunch and a long fruits peduncle unlike what happened with the germplasm the socioeconomic profile of the farmers did not follow a geographical pattern facing the scenario of establishment of the biofuel program in the region we proposed an on farm conservation strategy consisting in the exclusive use of local nontoxic germplasm which will need the involvement of all the stakeholders and in special of the local plant nurseries as this is difficult to achieve the ex situ conservation has been proposed as an emergency action even if the genetic erosion is stopped it is necessary to develop other companion measures to avoid the loss of

and genetically distinct populations then examined seedwater relations and germination following desiccation via equilibrium drying assays 05 to 91 rh −797 to −129 mpa germination ability after drying and subsequent cryofreezing treatments −196 °c 1 to 1440 min was also evaluated seeds of both populations displayed similar reverse sigmoid moisture sorption isotherms characteristic of desiccation tolerant tissues furthermore initial seed water potential −63 and −90 mpa was considerably lower than the lethal limit −20 mpa identified for desiccation sensitive tissues final germination range 58–93 and temporal patterns differed significantly between populations following desiccation and cryofreezing stress but these germination responses were similar to initial germination a higher proportion of nongerminated yet viable seeds remained for the northern compared to southern population location does influence germination response but differential germination is related to seed dormancy rather than desiccation or cryofreezing sensitivity ex situ conservation of u paniculata is therefore feasible across the latitudinal gradient studied here © 2017 springer sciencebusiness

basic function of transferrin is to bind iron iii ions in the medium and to deliver them to the locations where they are required for metabolic processes it also takes part in the host immune defense mainly via its ability to bind to iron iii ions hence transferrin is also identified as an important acutephase protein in host immunity abalones are major shellfish aquaculture crops that are susceptible to a range of marine microbial infections since transferrin is known to be a major player in innate immunity in the present study we sought to identify and molecularly and functionally

detected by qpcr in abalones where mantle and muscle showed high abtrf expression levels three immune challenge experiments were conducted using vibrio parahaemolyticus listeria monocytogenes and lps as stimuli and subsequently abtrf mrna expression levels were quantified in gill and hemocytes in a timecourse manner the mrna expression was greatly induced in both tissues in response to both challenges evidencing the functional property of transferrins recombinant abtrf nterminal domain abtrfn showed dosedependent iron iii binding activity detected by chrome azurol s cas assay system moreover recombinant abtrfn could significantly inhibit the growth of irondependent bacterium escherichia coli in a dosedependent manner however abtrfn was unable to show any detectable bacteriostatic

developed vs developing countries and emphasis of the collection most collections are expanding but they vary in rates of turnover of accessions with some having high rates of loss most collections maintain germplasm primarily as field collections but greenhouses nurseries and cryopreservation are used by some pest and disease problems are an economic problem for most collections and affect a wide range of accessions loss of accessions due to these problems affects only two collections relatively few collections distribute germplasm beyond the country in which they are located most collections report having inadequate funding and need new trained staff to better manage citrus germplasm we conclude that a global citrus germplasm network is needed with resources to provide stable

niches with the wide availability of molecular methods species are now often recognized genetically rather than morphologically as is for example the case for the more than 40 genetic species of the ostracod eucypris virens jurine 1820 here we used bspline outline analyses of the right valve in an attempt to morphologically recognize the genetic e virens species from europe north africa and australia from their valve shape ostracod outline analyses capture valve variability in a multidimensional and quantitative way and allow fast screening of large numbers of specimens in our study two significant valve clusters were identified from subsequent ordination and regression analyses but without any clear link to genetic species identity geographical location gender or reproductive mode whether standardized for size or not there is also no effect of polyploidy on valve shape thus genetic e virens species cannot currently be recognized morphologically by valve shape and are considered to be cryptic species because of their extensive fossil record ostracods are widely used as proxies for palaeoecological applications such as reconstructions of past climates species within fossil ostracod assemblages can usually be identified only by their valve characters our results imply that the occurrence of cryptic species complexes leads to underestimates of fossil diversity in palaeontological studies it is further possible that these cryptic species have different ecological tolerances with the risk of weakening predictions based on palaeoecological reconstructions

using eight issr primers in which 50 bands 769 were polymorphic with an average of 81 polymorphic fragments per primer alternatively another 244 bands were observed using eight srap primer combinations and 163 668 of them were polymorphic with an average of 305 polymorphic fragments per primer the unweighted pairgroup method upgma analysis showed that these 13 populations could be classified into three groups by the issr marker and two groups by the srap marker principal coordinate analysis using srap was completely identical to the upgmabased clustering although this was partly confirmed by the results of upgma cluster analysis using the issr marker this study provides insights into the genetic background of e ulmoides intraspecific hybrids the progenies of the

springerverlag berlin heidelberg small rna pathways act at the front line of defence against transposable elements across the eukaryota in animals piwi interacting small rnas pirnas are a crucial arm of this defence however the evolutionary relationships among pirnas and other small rna pathways targeting transposable elements are poorly resolved to address this question we sequenced small rnas from multiple diverse nematode species producing the first phylumwide analysis of how small rna pathways evolve surprisingly despite their prominence in caenorhabditis elegans and closely related nematodes pirnas are absent in all other nematode lineages we found that there are at least two evolutionarily distinct mechanisms that compensate for the absence of pirnas both involving rnadependent rna polymerases rdrps whilst one pathway is unique to nematodes the second involves dicerdependent rnadirected dna methylation hitherto unknown in animals and bears striking similarity to transposoncontrol mechanisms in fungi and plants our results highlight the rapid contextdependent evolution of small rna pathways and suggest pirnas in animals may have replaced an ancient eukaryotic

factor for aerobic growth and oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport system the biosynthetic pathway for coq has been proposed mainly from biochemical and genetic analyses of escherichia

in coq synthesis in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe here we expand these findings by identifying ten genes  dps1 dlp1 ppt1 and coq39 that are required for coq synthesis coq10deficient s pombe coq deletion strains were generated and characterized all mutant fission yeast strains were sensitive to oxidative stress produced a large amount of sulfide required an antioxidant to grow on minimal medium and did not survive at the stationary phase to compare the biosynthetic pathway of coq in fission yeast with that in higher eukaryotes the ability of coq biosynthetic genes from humans

species showed similar ino expression patterns indicative of the conservation of an outer integument however expression of ett which occurs in the boundary of the outer and inner integuments was altered in unitegmic ovules which showed lack of ett expression these results strongly suggest that the presence of a single integument could be attributable to the amalgamation of two integuments and support the role of ett in the fusion of the outer and inner integuments in unitegmic ovules a situation that could be widespread in other unitegmic species of angiosperms © 2015 new phytologist trust a focus on the phenotypic characteristics of microorganismstheir traitsoffers a path for interpreting the growing amount of microbiome datawe review key aspects of microbial traits as well as approaches used to assay their phylogenetic distribution recent studies reveal that microbial traits are differentially conserved across the tree of life and appear to be conserved in a hierarchical fashion possibly linked to their biochemical complexity these results suggest a predictive framework whereby the genetic or taxonomic resolution of microbiome variation among samples provides information about the traits under selection the organizational parallels seen among human and freeliving microbiomes seem to support this idea developments in this framework may offer predictions not only for how microbial composition responds to changing environmental conditions but also for how these changes may alter the health or functioning in human engineered and environmental systems the conservation of rare plant species as living collections in botanic gardens and arboreta has become an established tool in the battle against worldwide species extinctions however the establishment of ex situ collections with a high conservation value requires a sound understanding of the evolutionary processes that may reduce the suitability of these collections for future reintroductions particularly risks such as fitness decline of cultivated plants over time trait shifts and loss of adaptation to the original habitat due to changes in selection regimes have rarely been addressed so far based on a literature review and results of our own project we show that genetic drift can lead to fitness decline in ex situ cultivated plants but these drift effects strongly depend on the conditions and cultivation history in the ex situ facility furthermorewe provide evidence that shifts in traits such as germination and flowering time and a decrease in stress tolerance to drought and competition can reduce the conservation value of ex situ collections these threats associated with ex situ conditions require more attention by researchers curators and conservationists we need to increase knowledge on traits that are subject to novel selection pressures in ex situ collections and to define population sizes that prevent genetic drift establishing conservation networks with replicated collections across gardens and balancing the seed contribution of mother plants to the next generation within a collection are suggested as first steps to increase the conservation value of

problem however increasing intensity of food production in agricultural systems has driven reductions in farmland biodiversity a major challenge is to enable biodiversity conservation whilst addressing the problem of food security here we describe how facilitative plantplant interactions in crop systems could be used to help strike this balance an obvious example is that of intercropping systems where combinations of crop species can  under some circumstances  deliver reduced inputs of agrochemicals fertilizers pesticides per unit yield with potential knockon benefits for biodiversity conservation other facilitative processes can also play a role in biodiversity conservation increased intraspecific crop genetic diversity can help protect crops from pests and diseases although overlooked in facilitation research we argue that the mechanisms operate in a manner which is directly analogous to associational defence against herbivores a process well recognized in the facilitation literature as with intercropping the benefits to nature conservation arise from reduced pesticide use per unit harvested crop crops may have facilitative effects on some arable weed species particularly those that are currently considered rare in intensive farming systems work is in its early stages to understand the underlying mechanisms but it appears that crops might create niche space to which some weed species are adapted increasing plant species diversity through niche space creation may then have cascading benefits for other components of farmland biodiversity our new understanding of facilitative processes arising from work on crop systems has lessons for the study of facilitative interactions in natural and seminatural communities we argue that although easier to identify and quantify in crop systems some of these facilitative processes have to date been overlooked in studies of noncrop systems and certainly deserve further consideration finally we discuss what steps may be needed to move from our understanding of the role of facilitation to the development of new agricultural practice in some cases the challenge may be one of the encouraging

estimates of the spatial distribution of suitable habitats and landscape dispersal permeability under presentday past and future conditions we use empirical genetic data and approximate bayesian computation to estimate unknown demographic parameters finally we employ these parameters to simulate realistic and complex models of responses to future environmental shifts we contrast parameterized models under current and future landscapes to quantify the expected magnitude of change key results we implement this framework on neutral genetic data available from penstemon deustus our results predict that future climate change will result in geographically widespread declines in genetic diversity in this species the extent of reduction will heavily depend on the continuity of population

characteristics of a highspeed train including traction characteristic and regenerative braking and the railway geographical conditions consisting of slope curve and tunnel parameters are fully considered in the dynamic model in order to make it more effective and practical a new optimal strategy for train operation is developed and its novelty lies in the fact that it is the first time to optimize the actual speed curve using the method of dual speed curve optimization which contains two processes of offline global optimization and online local optimization thus leading to more energy saving as compared with most existing methods with only onetime optimization process we utilize combination optimization techniques in tandem with the speed codes and subsections to solve the global optimization problem with a genetic algorithm predictive control is developed for local optimization to refine the global optimization in real time more particularly the train operation modes including traction cruise coast and braking are switched on the base of the line slope information from which a more energyefficient speed trajectory is generated under the constraints of fixed time and distance to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy operation of chr3 on highspeed railway is tested through the comparison of energy consumption in two typical cases it verifies that the proposed energysaving strategy works better than that of single optimization strategy at the same time the actual speed deviation can be corrected in a timely manner with the proposed method Â©

acknowledged since it affects other environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation also influencing the distribution of plant species and potentially intraspecific genetic variation in this study we hypothesize that molecular haplotype variation within four macaronesian bryophyte species covaries with other diversity variables for two altitudinal levels methods – samples with molecular and floristic data were grouped into two altitudinal levels for mean comparisons we measured the genetic diversity haplotype diversity of four bryophytes exsertotheca intermedia isothecium prolixum frullania polysticta and porella canariensis and determined floristic richness variables as well as each species cover using the data collected in 92 plots across the natural laurel forest of madeira island molecular analyses included the sequencing of its158sits2 and the chloroplast dna rps4trnttrnl region a haplotype diversity index based on haplotype frequencies was also calculated and compared with the percentage of sporophytes for each studied species key results – the results obtained by the mean comparisons revealed that bryophyte species richness and endemic species richness are higher for high altitudes levels in the natural forest a coincident pattern between the species richness and the genetic diversity was observed for the mosses i prolixum and e intermedia in which a higher species cover and genetic diversity occurred at high altitudes however f polysticta displayed an inverse pattern and p canariensis did not present any significant differences in cover and haplotype frequency means conclusion – from a conservation and management perspective our findings highlight the importance of maintaining large patches of macaronesian bryophyte species since our

plants sampled from all studied sites were compared in terms of the biometrical characteristics populations 3 and 4 were found to be most similar population 1 was less similar and population 2 was the most different of all populations probably due to strong anthropogenic pressure electrophoretic analysis of seed and leaf storage proteins of isopyrum thalictroides obtained from the four sites demonstrated that the populations were quite similar genetically no matter how distant they were from each another population 2 was the most diverse followed by population 1 whereas populations 3 and 4 were the most similar a decreasing genetic distance in the i thalictroides population would lead to inbreeding as seed setting by the plants will be poorer and the seeds will be less viable which will result in a lower number of plants per a given area the decreased gene pool indicates that the population of i thalictroides is threatened with extinction in this area therefore it is warranted

under 2009gh trial was related to conserving water for the reproductive stage in rd7 and setting seeds early in rd10 water conservation also led to a lower percentage of flower and pod abortion in both rd7 and rd10 similarly in the 2010gh trial reduced water extraction during vegetative stage in events rd2 rd7 and rd9 was critical for better seed filling in the pods produced from late flowers in rd2 and reduced percentage of flower and pod abortion in rd2 and rd9 however in the 2010f trial the increased seed yield and hi in rd9 compared with c235 came along only with small changes in water uptake and podding pattern probably not causal events rd2 2010gh rd7 2010gh and rd10 2009gh with higher seed yield also had higher te than c235 the results suggest that dreb1a a transcription factor

from the nearby region of vitebsk in belarus a total of 345 individuals were examined analyses were performed with the use of eight ssr primers specific to p patens and three isj primers results ssr markers revealed a higher level of genetic variation than isj markers he  0609 he  0145 respectively an analysis of molecular variance amova revealed that the overall genetic diversity between the analyzed populations defined by parameters fst and Φpt for ssr 20 and Φpt for isj 21 markers was similar analysis conducted in the structure program divided analyzed populations into two groups ssr loci and three groups isj markers mantel test revealed correlations between the geographic distance and genetic diversity of polish populations of p patens for isj markers but not for ssr markers conclusions the results of the present study suggest that isj markers can complement the analyses based on ssrs however neutral and adaptive markers should not be alternatively applied neutral

opposite between arabidopsis and rice the evolution of angiosperm pin1 proteincoding sequences appears to have been primarily driven by purifying selection but traces of positive selection associated with sequences from certain families also seem to be present we verified this observation by calculating the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes on each branch of a phylogenetic tree our results indicate that the evolution of angiosperm pin1 sequences involve strong purifying selection in addition our results suggest that the conserved sequences of pin1 derive from a combination of the familyspecific site variations and conserved motifs during their unique evolutionary processes which is critical for the functional integrity and stability of these auxin transporters especially in new species finally functional difference of pin1 is likely to be present in angiosperm because the positive selection is occurred in one branch of poaceae © 2014 wang et al background the basic helixloophelix bhlh proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors that can bind to specific dna target sites they have been well characterized in model plants such as arabidopsis and rice and have been shown to be important regulatory components in many different biological processes however no systemic analysis of the bhlh transcription factor family has yet been reported in tomatoes tomato yellow leaf curl virus tylcv threatens tomato production worldwide by causing leaf yellowing leaf curling plant stunting and flower abscission results a total of 152 bhlh transcription factors were identified from the entire tomato genome phylogenetic analysis of bhlh domain sequences from arabidopsis and tomato facilitated classification of these genes into 26 subfamilies the evolutionary and possible functional relationships revealed during this analysis are supported by other criteria including the chromosomal distribution of these genes the conservation of motifs and exonintron structural patterns and the predicted dna binding activities within subfamilies distribution mapping results showed bhlh genes were localized on the 12 tomato chromosomes among the 152 bhlh genes from the tomato genome 96 bhlh genes were detected in the tylcvsusceptible and resistant tomato breeding line before 0 dpi and after tylcv 357 dpi infection as anticipated gene ontology go analysis indicated that most bhlh genes are related to the regulation of macromolecule metabolic processes and gene expression only four bhlh genes were differentially expressed between 0 and 357 dpi virusinduced gene silencing vigs of one bhlh genes slybhlh131 in resistant lines can lead to the cell death conclusion in the present study 152 bhlh transcription factor genes were identified one of which bhlh genes slybhlh131 was found to be involved in the tylcv infection through qrtpcr expression analysis and vigs validation the isolation and identification of these bhlh transcription factors facilitated clarification of the molecular genetic basis for the genetic improvement of tomatoes and the development of functional gene resources for transgenic research in addition these findings may

in xylan biosynthesis has been gained in the model plant species arabidopsis two homologous pairs irregular xylem 9 irx99l and irx1414l from glycosyltransferase gt family 43 have been proved to play crucial roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis however xylan biosynthesis in grass such as miscanthus remains poorly understood results we characterized seven gt43 members in m lutarioriparius a promising bioenergy crop quantitative realtime rtpcr qrtpcr analysis revealed that the expression of mlgt43 genes was ubiquitously detected in the tissues examined insitu hybridization demonstrated that mlgt43ab and mlgt43fg were specifically expressed in sclerenchyma while mlgt43ce were expressed in both sclerenchyma and parenchyma all seven mlgt43 proteins were localized to golgi apparatus overexpression of mlgt43ae but not mlgt43f and mlgt43g in arabidopsis irx9 fully or partially rescued the mutant defects including morphological changes collapsed xylem and increased xylan contents whereas overexpression of mlgt43f and mlgt43g but not mlgt43ae complemented the defects of irx14 indicating that mlgt43ae are functional orthologues of irx9 while mlgt43f and mlgt43g are functional orthologues of irx14 however overexpression of all seven mlgt43 genes could not rescue the mucilage defects of irx14 seeds furthermore transient transactivation analyses of mlgt43ae reporters demonstrated that mlgt43a and mlgt43b but not mlgt43ce were differentially activated by mlsnd1 mlmyb46 or mlvnd7 conclusion the results demonstrated that all seven mlgt43s are functionally conserved

and have important applications in diverse fields such as human medicine forensics plant and animal breeding conservation and evolutionary biology traditionally both parameters are calculated from pedigrees but are now increasingly estimated from genetic marker data conceptually a pedigree gives the expected f and r values fp and rp with the expectations being taken hypothetically over an infinite number of individuals with the same pedigree in contrast markers give the realised actual f and r values at the particular marker loci of the particular individuals fm and rm both pedigree fp rp and marker fm rm estimates can be used as inferences of genomic inbreeding coefficients fg and genomic relatedness rg which are the underlying quantities relevant to most applications such as estimating inbreeding depression and heritability of f and r in the pregenomic era it was widely accepted that pedigrees are much better than markers in delineating fg and rg and markers should better be used to validate amend and construct pedigrees rather than to replace them is this still true in the genomic era when genomewide dense snps are available in this simulation study i showed that genomic markers can yield much better estimates of fg and rg than pedigrees when they are numerous say 104 snps under realistic situations eg genome and population sizes pedigree estimates are especially poor for species with a small genome where fg and rg are determined to a large extent by mendelian segregations and may thus deviate substantially from their expectations fp and rp simulations also confirmed that fm when estimated from many snps can be much more powerful than fp for detecting inbreeding depression in viability however i argue that pedigrees cannot be replaced completely by genomic snps because the former allows for the calculation of more complicated ibd coefficients involving more than 2 individuals more than one locus and more than 2 genes at a locus for which the latter may have reduced capacity or limited power and because the former has social and other significance for remote relationships which have little genetic significance and cannot be

on the orchid breeding programme to assist the orchid industry in malaysia the programme consists of the germplasm collection and hybridization program the germplasm collection of wild orchids started in 1976 as a conservation effort to protect the endemic species which were becoming extinct due to massive clearance of jungles and forest for development activities a total of 1500 accessions of orchid species covering areas in peninsular malaysia and sabah were collected and conserved to expand the diversity species from our neighbouring countries were also collected the plants were grown in an orchidarium where an environment similar to the natural habitat of the species was created these species were documented and evaluated based on their morphological and adaptation characteristics the germplasm served as source of genetic materials for the hybridization work the hybridization breeding program was initially started to produce new hybrids for cutflower and potted plant production but later the development of heattolerant orchids became one of the main objectives due to the high demand for orchids in landscaping good flower characteristics such as flower color shape long inflorescence long shelf life and freeflowering plant characteristics are traits required for the cutflower production for pot plants besides flower quality the novel characteristics ie unique shape and fragrance were also emphasized as a result a total of thirty hybrids were developed and could be introduced as potential hybrids for commercialization sound wildlife conservation decisions require

camera trapping for 8 monthly surveys at 50 2012 and 76 2013 sites in the rocky mountains of alberta canada we used multimethod occupancy models to estimate site occupancy probability of detection and conditional occupancy at a hair trap we tested the prediction that detection error in ngt studies could be induced by temporal variability within season leading to underestimation of occupancy ngt via hair trapping consistently underestimated grizzly bear occupancy at a site when compared to camera trapping at best occupancy was underestimated by 50 at worst by 95 probability of false absence was reduced through successive surveys but this mainly accounts for error imparted by movement among repeated surveys not necessarily missed detections by extant bears the implications of missed

nine of them included in the iucn red list of threatened species  have been described to date inhabiting the madeiran and canarian archipelagos a previous phylogenetic study revealed that the diversification of cheirolophus in macaronesia started less than 2 ma as a result of such an explosive speciation process limited phylogenetic resolution was reported mainly due to the low variability of the employed molecular markers in the present study we used highly polymorphic aflp markers to i evaluate species boundaries ii infer their evolutionary relationships and iii investigate the patterns of genetic diversity in relation to the potential processes likely involved in the radiation of cheirolophus one hundred and seventytwo individuals representing all macaronesian cheirolophus species were analysed using 249 aflp loci our results suggest that geographic isolation played an important role in this radiation process this was likely driven by the combination of poor gene flow capacity and a good ability for sporadic longdistance colonisations in addition we also found some traces of introgression and incipient ecological adaptation which could have further enhanced the extraordinary diversification of cheirolophus in macaronesia last we hypothesize that current threat categories assigned to macaronesian cheirolophus species do not reflect their respective

with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material which though it may provide forest cover in the short term will not likely establish a selfsustaining ecosystem the value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers however insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term in this article we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species with a particular focus on genetic considerations our discussion is organised across three themes i species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material ii increasing resilience by fostering natural selection

variation in eight leaf traits in 60 coffea arabica plants across four management treatments differing in shadetree species composition to test i if hypothesized les patterns also describe withinspecies trait variation and ii if les traits vary in response to management regimes or are correlated with reproductive output leaf traits varied widely across coffee plants with photosynthetic rates amass and leaf area showing especially high variation in bivariate and multivariate analyses coffee leaf traits covaried in patterns consistent with the les suggesting shifts between leaflevel resource acquisition and conservation traits among plants may also underpin coffee responses to agroforestry management the position of a coffee plant along the les as described by a principal component analysis score was best explained by light availability but did not vary systematically with shade tree composition les traits were weakly but significantly related to plantlevel reproductive output coffee plants associated with lower amass and leaf n values and higher leaf mass per area were associated with greater reproductive output in showing that the les describes resource capture andor conservation strategies among coffee plants our study represents a novel adoption of the les to address applied questions in managed systems since within species differences in

microcompartment in addition depending on phylogeny as many as 13 other genes are found to cooccur near or within αcarboxysome operons one of these genes codes for a protein with distant homology to pterin4αcarbinolamine dehydratase pcd enzymes it is present in all αcarboxysome containing bacteria and has homologs in algae and higher plants canonical pcds play an important role in amino acid hydroxylation a reaction not associated with carbon fixation we determined the crystal structure of an αcarboxysome pcdlike protein from the chemoautotrophic bacterium thiomonas intermedia k12 at 13Å resolution the protein retains a threedimensional fold similar to canonical pcds although the prominent active site cleft present in pcd enzymes is disrupted in the αcarboxysome pcdlike protein using a cellbased complementation assay we tested the pcdlike proteins from t intermedia and two additional bacteria and found no evidence for pcd enzymatic activity however we discovered that heterologous coexpression of the pcdlike protein from halothiobacillus neapolitanus with rubisco and groels in escherichia coli increased the amount of soluble assembled rubisco recovered from cell lysates compared with coexpression of rubisco with groels alone we conclude that this conserved pcdlike protein renamed here αcarboxysome rubisco assembly factor or acraf is a novel rubisco chaperone integral

day clocks enable organisms to maintain adaptive timing of their daily behavioral activities and physiological functions eukaryotic clocks consist of core transcriptiontranslation feedback loops that generate a cycle and posttranslational modifiers that maintain that cycle at about 24 h we use the pitcherplant mosquito wyeomyia smithii subfamily culicini tribe sabethini to test whether evolutionary divergence of the circadian clock genes in this species relative to other insects has involved primarily genes in the core feedback loops or the posttranslational modifiers heretofore there is no reference transcriptome or genome sequence for any mosquito in the tribe sabethini which includes over 375 mainly circumtropical species methods we sequenced assembled and annotated the transcriptome of w smithii containing nearly 95  of conserved singlecopy orthologs in animal genomes we used the translated contigs and singletons to determine the average rates of circadian clockgene divergence in w smithii relative to three other mosquito genera to drosophila to the butterfly danaus and to the wasp nasonia results over 108 million cdna sequence reads were obtained consisting of 4325 million nucleotides their assembly produced 25904 contigs and 54418 singletons of which 62  and 28  are annotated as proteincoding genes respectively sharing homology with other animal proteomes discussion the w smithii transcriptome includes all nine circadian transcriptiontranslation feedbackloop genes and all eight posttranslational modifier genes we sought to identify fig 1 after aligning translated w smithii contigs and singletons from this transcriptome with other insects we determined that there was no significant difference in the average divergence of w smithii from the six other taxa between the core feedbackloop genes and posttranslational modifiers conclusions the characterized transcriptome is sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to have uncovered all of the insect circadian clock genes we sought to identify fig 1 relative divergence does not differ between core feedbackloop genes and posttranslational modifiers of those genes in a sabethine species w

tormey et al the seed dispersal process is a crucial stage in plant regeneration and maintenance of forest biological diversity while the number of removed seeds is quantitative the distance to which a seed is removed from its origin is qualitative because it affects the probability that a seed will germinate and recruit to the next life stage however the creation of forest margins can negatively affect the seed dispersal process especially for largediaspore plant species in this study the diaspore removal and dispersal distance of caryocar coriaceum a tree with large diaspores that is in danger of extinction were analyzed the study was conducted for two consecutive years in a protected forest in northeastern brazil each year 1 200 diaspores with a nylon wire and a satin tape yellow were used and equally distributed in 120 experimental stations established on the forest margin and in the interior during the first year of the study no differences in diaspore removal and dispersal distance were found among the investigated environments however for the second year of the study the number of removed diaspores differed significantly nevertheless the dispersal distance was not different between the forest margin and the interior the low diaspore removal percentages suggest that species recruitment may be compromised because the diaspore accumulation close to the relatives enables higher fungi and insect attack in addition most of the few removed diaspores were found at short distances from their sources up to 5 m which can lead to low genetic variability virtually no diaspore was found buried by hoarding rodents and no diaspore was found preyed upon by these animals evidence found in this study suggests the local loss of species dispersers which can compromise the

pot1 is a conserved multifunctional protein that modulates telomerase activity and its engagement with telomeres arabidopsis thaliana encodes two divergent pot1 paralogs termed atpot1a and atpot1b atpot1a positively regulates telomerase activity whereas atpot1b is proposed to negatively regulate telomerase and promote chromosome end protection phylogenetic analysis uncovered two independent pot1 duplication events in the plant kingdom including one at the base of brassicaceae tests for positive selection implemented in paml revealed that the brassicaceae pot1a lineage experienced positive selection postduplication and identified three amino acid residues with signatures of positive selection a sensitive and quantitative genetic complementation assay was developed to assess pot1a function in a thaliana the assay showed that atpot1a is functionally distinct from singlecopy pot1 genes in other plants moreover for two of the sites with a strong signature of positive selection substitutions that swap the amino acids in atpot1a for residues found in atpot1b dramatically compromised atpot1a function in vivo in vitrobinding studies demonstrated that all three sites under positive selection specifically enhance the atpot1a interaction with ctc1 a core component of the highly conserved cst ctc1stn1ten1 telomere protein complex our results reveal a molecular mechanism for the role of these positively selected sites in atpot1a the data also provide an important empirical example to refine theories of duplicate gene retention as the outcome of positive selection here appears to be reinforcement of an ancestral function rather than neofunctionalization we propose that this outcome may not be unusual when the duplicated protein is a component of a

latitude flowering of many plants is controlled by seasonal changes in day length the photoperiodic flowering pathway confers this response in the brassicaceae which colonized temperate latitudes after divergence from the cleomaceae their subtropical sister family the constans co transcription factor of arabidopsis thaliana a member of the brassicaceae is central to the photoperiodic flowering response and shows characteristic patterns of transcription required for daylength sensing co is believed to be widely conserved among flowering plants however we show that it arose after gene duplication at the root of the brassicaceae followed by divergence of transcriptional regulation and protein function co has two close homologs constanslike1 col1 and col2 which are related to co by tandem duplication and wholegenome duplication respectively the single co homolog present in the cleomaceae shows transcriptional and functional features similar to those of col1 and col2 suggesting that these were ancestral we detect cisregulatory and codon changes characteristic of co and use transgenic assays to demonstrate their significance in the daylengthdependent activation of the co target gene flowering locus t thus the function of co as a potent photoperiodic flowering switch evolved in the brassicaceae after gene duplication the origin of co may have contributed to the range

standard nursery container mixes and inorganic substrates the yarey palm seeds were sown at two different depths 05 inch and at the surface seed half exposed mean maximum germination across all treatments for yarey palm was 79 and for buccaneer palm 60 the standard nursery mixes generally fostered the best germination and longterm survival this is likely due to a combination of the lower water availability at the surfaces of the more porous inorganic substrates sand and perlite and greater difficulty for coarse palm roots to penetrate the denser inorganic substrates including fired ceramic which otherwise had similar waterholding capacity whc and even lower air space than the organic substrates difficulty of penetration caused roots of some seedlings to either dry up early in germination as in the surface sown yarey palm or to ‘‘push up’’ the seed buccaneer palm rather than penetrating the substrate and this was often fatal thus inorganic substrates are not recommended for germination and early seedling growth of these palm species and planting the seeds slightly below the surface may be preferable to surface sowing for conservation horticulture of wildcollected palm

are considered rare and threatened by anthropogenic factors such as landuse change addressing the global need for ex situ rescue populations of such species we investigated whether certain methods of wildsource seed collection harvest greater amounts of genetic variation from the source population while minimizing the costs expended we used an individualbased computer program newgarden to conduct simulation trials examining which aspects of seed procurement provided the most costeffective methods for maximal rare allele capture for single isolated populations of rare tropical tree species aspects examined included the geometric pattern of harvesting location of seed collections within the spatial distribution of the population central vs peripheral geometric partitioning of sampling regions contiguous vs subdivided gene dispersal distance linear travelling costs and ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled results demonstrated that ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled had the highest effect on genetic diversity harvested relative to sampling location or geometric pattern of collection explaining 82 and 79 of the variance in alleles harvested respectively collecting from subdivided peripheral sampling regions and populations having long distance gene dispersal led to increases of up to 39 and 51 in the amount of genetic variation conserved respectively these results suggest that ex situ conservation efforts for rare tropical trees can benefit by collecting fewer seeds from each of a larger number of trees sampling from peripheral subdivided regions of the population rather than in a contiguous centrally located one under the transect or nearest neighbor strategies and adjusting harvesting based on the dispersal biology of the source population this

spread and genetic exchange of species isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity however while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a selfsustaining habitat network in our study we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns grasslands in residential areas playgrounds or parks in the city of münster germany employing a graph theory approach which uses a map graph of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances 2 m 20 m 44 m and 100 m this approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands our results show for the first time that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of shortdistance dispersal but slightly increases for longdistance dispersal except two larger conglomerations of wellconnected patches urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected thus future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement the graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to

period recently in the framework of a genetic resource conservation program most of the accessions collected at crea in recent decades were planted in a single block to evaluate their characteristics the presence of many selections in the same block of the same age and grafted on the same rootstock is extremely important for a reliable characterization of the pomological characters particularly pigmentation which is strongly influenced by both the environment and the rootstock the collection consists of 88 genotypes including old lines and nucellar selections some commercial tarocco moro and sanguinello varieties were also included in the collection to facilitate comparison among clones moreover the pomological features of 20 elite tarocco clones cultivated nearby in the same experimental station were used as a further reference the pomological characterization based on 13 traits and performed in two consecutive years revealed significant variability some genotypes showed strong yeartoyear variability mainly in fruit pigmentation probably due to different climatic conditions during winter similarly other traits such as fruit size total soluble solids and acidity also varied among and within the varietal groups these findings have a potential utility in identifying promising clones which might fulfil the growing market needs such as higher anthocyanin content and longer

university all rights reserved results we performed a largescale phylogenomic analysis of branching and debranching enzymes in over 400 completely sequenced genomes including more than 200 from eukaryotes we show that branching and debranching enzymes can be found in all kingdoms of life including all major groups of eukaryotes and thus were likely to have been present in the last universal common ancestor luca but have been lost in seemingly random fashion in numerous singlecelled eukaryotes we also show how animal branching and debranching enzymes evolved from their luca ancestors by acquiring additional domains furthermore we show that enzymes commonly perceived as orthologous such as human branching enzyme gbe1 and e coli branching enzyme glgb are in fact related by a gene duplication and consequently paralogous
background branched polymers of glucose are universally used for energy storage in cells taking the form of glycogen in animals fungi bacteria and archaea and of amylopectin in plants some enzymes involved in glycogen and amylopectin metabolism are similarly conserved in all forms of life but some interestingly are not in this paper we focus on the phylogeny of glycogen branching and debranching enzymes respectively involved in introducing and removing of the α16 bonds in glucose polymers bonds that provide the unique branching structure to glucose polymers
conclusions despite being usually associated with animal liver glycogen and plant starch energy storage in the form of branched glucose polymers is clearly an ancient process and has probably been present in the last universal common ancestor of all present life the evolution of the enzymes enabling this form of energy storage is more complex than previously thought and illustrates the need for explicit phylogenomic analysis in the study of even seemingly simple metabolic enzymes patterns of conservation in the evolution of the glycogenstarch branching and debranching enzymes hint at some as

and finescale spatial genetic structure fsgs in the clonal distylous aquatic herb menyanthes trifoliata to investigate genetic diversity and structure we used microsatellite markers and genotyped a total of 510 ramets from nine populations in southern belgium the populations showed a relatively high degree of genetic diversity hec080 a12445 even if both expected heterozygosity and allelic richness significantly decreased with decreasing population size genet numbers populations were significantly genetically differentiated fst014 indicating reduced gene flow among populations morph ratio for genets did not deviate from 11 the phalanx type of clonal growth dominated in the studied populations ramet fsgs which was strongly affected by clonality was significant in all populations sp statistic significantly decreased with increasing population size indicating higher fsgs in smaller populations consequently small populations may suffer from a higher rate of geitonogamous pollination between ramets of the same genet since m trifoliata is a strongly selfincompatible herb no inbred seeds can be produced from self and geitonogamous pollination in this case reproductive success of small and more spatially structured populations of m trifoliata may be reduced due to clogging of stigmas with incompatible pollen we conclude that understanding genetic diversity and

representing over half of all known sites n p 71 sites we sequenced eight variable loci which were used to construct distancebased trees and calculate populationassignment probabilities to investigate population structure and we tested isolation by distance by correlating genetic similarity with geographic distance among populations pivotal results all plants sampled from the same wetland ie a population were genetically identical with low heterozygosity and there was little to no variation among clustered wetlands within a site scirpus ancistrochaetus was genetically structured across its range notably all populations from new england were genetically identical to each other but differed from all other populations and a similar pattern was observed for northern pennsylvania populations three genetic clusters were identified including a primarily new england cluster a primarily pennsylvanian cluster and a southern appalachian cluster and overall genetic distances were consistent with isolation by distance although genetic clusters mostly corresponded with geography some populations did not show this geographicgenetic association suggesting longdistance dispersal for example one population from west virginia was assigned to the new england cluster overall the highest genetic diversity was found within pennsylvania and nearby states conclusions whether similarity between geographically distant locations is due to animalmediated gene flow or retention of ancestral alleles needs additional study additionally the development of a large number of new markers may help to reveal diversity in areas such as new england with wetlands that did not have any diversity using our markers nevertheless conservation of different genetic clusters at a regional scale is important

identified as 602cheong and a nongrafted control overall above ground vegetative growth was significantly lower for 602jjak in comparison to the other plant lines moreover water potential reduction in response to mild drought was significantly less for 602jjak yet stomatal conductance of all plantlines were equally inhibited by milddrought light saturated photosynthesis of 602jjak was less affected by low water potential than the other two lines as was the  reduction in mesophyll conductance therefore the jjak kkung rootstock caused aboveground growth reduction water conservation and increased photosynthetic tolerance of mild drought these data show that different rootstocks can change the photosynthetic responses to drought of a high yielding commercial tomato line also this rapid

we used variation partitioning in multiple regressions to quantify crosstaxon congruence in community dissimilarities of vascular plants geometrid and arciinid moths and carabid beetles subsequently investigating their respective underpinning by abiotic factors and biotic interactions significant crosstaxon congruence observed across all taxon pairs was linked to their similar responses towards elevation change changes in the vegetation composition were closely linked to carabid turnover with vegetation structure and associated microclimatic conditions proposed causes of this link in contrast moth assemblages appeared to be dominated by generalist species whose turnover was weakly associated with vegetation changes overall abiotic factors exerted a stronger influence on crosstaxon

japonica indica and o brachyanth a genomes respectively our analysis showed that 605 and 556 of the rgenes are tandemly repeated within clusters and distributed over all the rice chromosomes in indica and japonica genomes respectively the phylogenetic analysis along with motif distribution shows high degree of conservation of r and drgenes in clusters in silico expression analysis of rgenes and drgenes showed more than 85 were expressed genes showing corresponding est matches in the databases this study gave special emphasis on mechanisms of gene evolution and duplication for r and dr genes across species analysis of paralogs across rice species indicated 17 and 438 rgenes 29 and 1163 drgenes duplication in indica and oryza brachyantha as compared to 20 and 26 duplication of rgenes and drgenes in japonica respectively we found that during the course of duplication only 95 of r and drgenes changed their function and rest of the genes have maintained their identity syntenic relationship across three genomes inferred that more orthology is shared between indica and japonica genomes as compared to brachyantha genome genome wide identification of rgenes and drgenes in the rice genome will help in allele mining and functional validation of these genes and to understand molecular mechanism of disease resistance and their evolution in rice and related species © 2015 singh

environmental conditions water content and temperature the effect of water content down to 001 g·h2o·g1 on seed viability was studied at different temperatures for a 5year storage period in taxonomically related species seeds of seven brassicaceae species brassica repanda eruca vesicaria malcolmia littorea moricandia arvensis rorippa nasturtiumaquaticum sinapis alba sisymbrium runcinatum were stored at 48 environments comprising a combination of eight water contents from 021 to 001 g·h2o·g1 dw and six temperatures 45 35 20 5 25 170 °c survival curves were modelled and p50 calculated for those conditions where germination was reduced over the 5year assay period critical water content for storage of seeds of six species at 45 °c ranged from 002 to 003 g·h2o·g1 the effect of extreme desiccation at 45 °c showed variability among species three species showed damaging effects of drying below the critical water content while for three species it was neither detrimental nor beneficial to seed longevity lipid content could be related to longevity depending on the storage conditions a variable seed longevity response to water content among taxonomically related species was found the relative position of some of the species as long or shortlived at 45 °c varied depending on the humidity at which storage behaviour was evaluated therefore predictions of survival under desiccated

various biological processes in plants considerable data are available on mirnas involved in the development of rice maize and barley in contrast little is known about mirnas and their functions in the development of wheat in this study five small rna srna libraries from wheat seedlings flag leaves and developing seeds were developed and sequenced to identify mirnas and understand their functions in wheat developmentresults twentyfour known mirnas belonging to 15 mirna families were identified from 18 mirna loci in wheat in the present study including 15 mirnas 9 mirna loci first identified in wheat 13 mirna families 16 mirna loci being highly conserved and 2 2 mirna loci moderately conserved in addition fiftyfive novel mirnas were also identified the potential target genes for 15 known mirnas and 37 novel mirnas were predicted using strict criteria and these target genes are involved in a wide range of biological functions four of the 15 known mirna families and 22 of the 55 novel mirnas were preferentially expressed in the developing seeds with logarithm log2 of the fold change of 10  76 and half of them were seedspecific suggesting that they participate in regulating wheat seed development and metabolism from 5 days postanthesis to 20 days postanthesis mir164 and mir160 increased in abundance in the developing seeds whereas mir169 decreased suggesting

background microsatellites or simple sequence repeats ssrs are highly informative molecular markers for various biological studies in plants in spruce  picea and other conifers the development of singlecopy polymorphic genomic microsatellite markers is quite difficult owing primarily to the large genome size and predominance of repetitive dna sequences throughout the genome we have developed highly informative singlelocus genomic microsatellite markers in black spruce picea mariana and red spruce picea rubens using a simple but efficient method based on a combination of aflp and microsatellite technologies principal findings a microsatelliteenriched library was constructed from genomic aflp dna fragments of black spruce sequencing of the 108 putative ssrcontaining clones provided 94 unique sequences with microsatellites twentytwo of the designed 34 primer pairs yielded scorable amplicons with singlelocus patterns fourteen of these microsatellite markers were characterized in 30 black spruce and 30 red spruce individuals drawn from many populations the number of alleles at a polymorphic locus ranged from 2 to 18 with a mean of 93 in black spruce and from 3

about how these rootassociated microbial communities change through the growing season and between seasons we analyzed the response of soil bacteria to roots of the common annual grass avena fatua over two growing seasons using highthroughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes over the two periods of growth the rhizosphere bacterial communities followed consistent successional patterns as plants grew although the starting communities were distinct succession in the rhizosphere was characterized by a significant decrease in both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity relative to background soil communities driven by reductions in both richness and evenness of the bacterial communities plant roots selectively stimulated the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes but reduced the abundance of acidobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes taxa that increased in relative abundance in the rhizosphere soil displayed phylogenetic clustering suggesting some conservation and an evolutionary basis for the response of complex soil bacterial communities to the presence of plant roots the reproducibility of rhizosphere succession and the apparent phylogenetic conservation of rhizosphere competence traits suggest adaptation of the indigenous bacterial community to this common grass over the many decades of its presence importance we document the successional patterns of rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with a “wild” annual grass avena fatua which is commonly a dominant plant in mediterraneantype annual grasslands around the world the plant was grown in its grassland soil most studies documenting rhizosphere microbiomes address “domesticated” plants growing in soils to which they are introduced rhizosphere bacterial communities exhibited a pattern of temporal succession that was consistent and repeatable over two growing seasons there are few studies assessing the reproducibility over multiple seasons through the growing season the rhizosphere community became progressively less diverse likely reflecting root homogenization of soil microniches phylogenetic clustering of the rhizosphere dynamic taxa suggests

related species however within virus orders and families strong conservation of gene order is observed the factors that constrain or promote geneorder diversity are largely unknown although the regulation of gene expression is one important constraint for viruses here we investigate why gene order is conserved for a positivestrand rna virus encoding a single polyprotein in the context of its authentic multicellular host initially we identified the most plausible trajectory by which alternative gene orders could evolve subsequently we studied the accessibility of key steps along this evolutionary trajectory by constructing two virus intermediates 1 duplication of a gene followed by 2 loss of the ancestral gene we identified five barriers to the evolution of alternative gene orders first the number of viable positions for reordering is limited second the withinhost fitness of viruses with gene duplications is low compared to the wildtype virus third after duplication the ancestral gene copy is always maintained and never the duplicated one fourth viruses with an alternative gene order have even lower fitness than viruses with gene duplications fifth after more than half a year of evolution in isolation viruses with an alternative gene order are still vastly inferior to the wildtype virus our results show that all steps along plausible evolutionary trajectories to alternative gene orders are highly unlikely hence the inaccessibility of these trajectories probably contributes to the conservation of gene order in presentday viruses © 2016 by the genetics society of america background the identification of qtl involved in heterosis formation is one approach to unravel the not yet fully understood genetic basis of heterosis  the improved agronomic performance of hybrid f1 plants compared to their inbred parents the identification of candidate genes underlying a qtl is important both for developing markers and determining the molecular genetic basis of a trait but remains difficult owing to the large number of genes often contained within individual qtl to address this problem in heterosis analysis we applied a metaanalysis strategy for grain yield gy of zea mays l as example incorporating qtl hybrid field and parental gene expression dataresults for the identification of genes underlying known heterotic qtl we made use of tight associations between gene expression pattern and the trait of interest identified by correlation analyses using this approach genes strongly associated with heterosis for gy were discovered to be clustered in pericentromeric regions of the complex maize genome this suggests that expression differences of sequences in recombinationsuppressed regions are important in the establishment of heterosis for gy in f1 hybrids and also in the conservation of heterosis for gy across genotypes importantly functional analysis of heterosisassociated genes from these genomic regions revealed overrepresentation of a number of functional classes identifying key processes contributing to heterosis for gy based on the finding that the majority of the analyzed heterosisassociated genes were addtitively expressed we propose a model referring to the influence of cisregulatory variation on heterosis for gy by the compensation of fixed detrimental expression levels in parentsconclusions the study highlights the utility of a metaanalysis approach that integrates phenotypic and multilevel molecular data to unravel complex traits in plants it provides prospects for the identification of genes relevant for qtl and also suggests a model for the potential role of additive expression in the formation and conservation of heterosis for gy via dominant multigenic quantitative trait loci our

this information was used to investigate the ecology of in situ oryza populations in introduced para grass swards urochloa mutica forssk tq nguyen and to understand interactions between the two sympatric oryza species primary dormancy in the two species is similar namely nondeep physiological dormancy determined by external maternal structures and broken by warm temperature treatments equivalent to dry season soil temperatures light quality smoke water gibberellic acid and nitric acid treatments had minor influences on germination changes to the soil profile and aboveground biomass structure due to swards of u mutica significantly affected emergence of o meridionalis thus the influence of soil temperature explains the results of previous field studies in which biomass or litter on the soil surface prevented germination this has implications for biodiversity management on monsoonal floodplains of northern australia where introduced pasture species produce greater biomass than native grasslands reduce soil temperatures and are displacing native rices there were differences between the oryza species  dormancy was more quickly broken in annual o meridionalis reflecting the

strategies for conservation of diversity it is common to select a core collection to represent the genetic diversity of a germplasm collection in order to minimize the cost of conservation while ensuring the maximization of genetic variation we aimed to solve two main problems 1 to select a set of individuals from an in situ data set that is genetically complementary to an existing germplasm collection and 2 to define a core collection for a germplasm collection we proposed a new multiobjective optimization moo approach based on principles of systematic conservation planning scp incorporating heterozygosity information therefore optimization takes genotypic diversity and variability patterns into account as well as a case study we used dipteryx alata microsatellite loci information from two sources an ex situ germplasm collection located at the agronomy school of the federal university of goiás ufgas and an in situ data set composed of 642 sampled individual trees we were able to identify within a population of several individuals the exact accessionssamples that should be chosen in order to preserve the species diversity we found that material from nine in situ individual trees are enough to complement the ufgas germplasm collection as it is and that it is possible to define a core collection of 20 individual trees representing all studied genetic diversity moreover we defined a method a protocol to deal with large amounts of accessions in the context of moo the proposed approach can be used to help constructing collections with maximal allelic richness and can also be extended to the in situ conservation as far as we know this is the first time that principles of scp and the moo approach are applied to the problem of complementing a germplasm

stressful conditions and species responses to simultaneous stressors may differ from those predicted based on the individual effects of each stressor alone we studied the influence of landuse disturbance forest drainage on fungal decomposer assemblages and leaf decomposition rates in naturally harsh low ph caused by blackshale dominated geology vs circumneutral streams we used pyrosequencing to determine fungal richness and assemblage structure decomposition rates did not differ between circumneutral and naturally acidic reference sites however the effect of forest drainage on microbial decomposition was more pronounced in the naturally acidic streams than in circumneutral streams singleeffect responses of fungal assemblages were mainly related to geology community similarity was significantly higher in the naturally acidic disturbed sites than in corresponding reference sites suggesting that landuse disturbance simplifies fungal assemblages in naturally stressful conditions naturally acidic streams supported distinct fungal assemblages with many otus operational taxonomic unit unique to these streams our results indicate that fungal assemblages in streams are sensitive to both structural and functional impairment in response to multiple stressors anthropogenic degradation of naturally acidic streams may decrease regional fungal diversity and

biographies facilitate teaching the ‘nature of science’ this case study focuses on how nikolai vavilov’s unrelenting sense of purpose courage and charismatic personality was maintained during violent revolutionary change in russia case description the rediscovery of gregor mendel’s laws of inheritance provided vavilov with a scientific foundation for crop improvement this foundation was later bolstered by vavilov’s personal drive to conserve plant biodiversity as he advanced theories and pragmatic approaches for genetic improvement and conservation of plants political leaders in russian came to reject mendel’s principles and eventually vavilov’s work discussion and evaluation this rejection occurred because joseph stalin was desperate for a quick remedy to the famine and suffering from forced collective agriculture vavilov’s work continued modernizing russian crop research while inspiring other scientists to save seeds stored in the world’s first gene bank three themes illustrating the nature of science help examine vavilov’s life explaining natural phenomena uncompromising human endeavor and revising scientific knowledge conclusions the case study concludes with four questions to stimulate student inquiry and selfguided research they also deepen student understanding of vavilov’s personal sacrifices to ensure use and conservation of plant biodiversity © 2016 the authors there are not many exhaustive works addressing the agromorphological characterization of traditional fig ficus carica l cultivars in spain in order to analyze the diversity of these fig genetic resources twelve traditional fig cultivars from the centralwestern region of spain were surveyed and characterized agromorphologically a total of forty descriptors mainly defined by the international plant genetic resources institute and the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants were used to describe the fruits leaves and the tree itself over two consecutive years 20132014 some of the cultivars showed distinctive and interesting agronomical characters from a commercial point of view such as two crops per year breba and fig high yields and

3150° brix easy to peel and juicy principal component analysis revealed that more than 67 of the agromorphological variability observed was explained by the first three components some of the breba size parameters fruit and neck length and fruit width being the most important factors in differentiating the genotypes a dendrogram clustered the cultivars into two major groups unifera and bifera type and revealed existing synonymies and homonymies carballar negra and moscatel were the only fig cultivars which did not have breba crops this work is an important step in the conservation of

were subjected to four different periods of exposure 15 30 45 and 60 min to plant vitrification solution 2 pvs2 before plunging into liquid nitrogen we evaluated the regrowth of h speciosa shoot tips that were cryopreserved by the classical vitrification technique and by the droplet vitrification technique shoot tips were submitted to different periods of preculture absence 24 or 48h in a medium containing 03 m sucrose prior to cryopreservation with a pvs2 exposure period of 60 min significant differences were observed between the two techniques used in this study with respect to regrowth rates however both cryopreservation methods allowed for a shoot tip regrowth rate of over 70 use of a preculture step increased the regrowth rate of cryopreserved shoot tips shoot tip cryopreservation

important genus © funpecrp tropical lowland rain forest tlrf biodiversity is under threat from anthropogenic factors including deforestation which creates forest fragments of different sizes that can further undergo various internal patterns of logging such interventions can modify previous equilibrium abundance and spatial distribution patterns of offspring recruitment andor pollen dispersal little is known about how these aspects of deforestation and fragmentation might synergistically affect tlrf tree recovery demographics and population genetics in newly formed forest fragments to investigate these tlrf anthropogenic disturbance processes we used the computer program newgarden ng which models spatiallyexplicit individualbased plant populations to simulate 10 deforestation in six different spatial logging patterns for the plant functional type of a longlived tlrf canopy tree species further each logging pattern was analyzed under nine varying patterns of offspring versus pollen dispersal distances that could have arisen postfragmentation results indicated that gene dispersal condition especially via offspring had a greater effect on population growth and genetic diversity retention explaining 985 and 888 of the variance respectively than spatial logging pattern 02 and 47 respectively with near distance dispersal maximizing population growth and genetic diversity relative to distant dispersal within logged regions of the fragment deforestation patterns closer to fragment borders more often exhibited lower population recovery rates and founding genetic diversity retention relative to more centrally located logging these results suggest newly isolated fragments have populations that are more sensitive to the way in which their offspring and pollen dispersers are affected than the spatial pattern in which subsequent logging occurs and that large variation in the recovery rates of different tlrf tree species attributable to altered gene dispersal regimens will be a likely outcome of fragmentation conservation implications include possible manual interventions manual manipulations of offspring dispersers andor pollinators in forest

critically endangered species the aim of this study was to estimate the degree and distribution of genetic diversity within european populations of this endangered species we screened 29 populations of p patens using a set of six microsatellite primers the results of our study indicate that the analyzed populations are characterized by low levels of genetic diversity ho  0005 and very high levels

being as low as 000 for most populations average genetic diversity over loci and mean number of alleles in p patens populations were significantly correlated with population size suggesting severe genetic drift the results of amova point to higher levels of variation within populations than between populations the results of structure and pcoa analyses suggest that the genetic structure of the studied p patens populations fall into three clusters corresponding to geographical regions the most isolated populations mostly from romania formed a separate group with a homogeneous gene pool located at the southern steppic part of the distribution range baltic mostly polish populations fall into two genetic groups which were not fully compatible with their geographic distribution our

rethinking of ecological and evolutionary timescales and their overlap and stimulated research on processes at their interface this premise lays at the heart of ecoevolutionary dynamics a relatively recent field redeveloping how we conceive of ecological and evolutionary processes classical evolutionary theory and empirical evidence has generally supported a gradualist view of evolution as occurring on much longer timescales than ecological processes the systematic documentation of rapid evolution beginning in the 1970s served as a catalyst to question this basic assumption the commonness of rapid evolution suggests that ecological and evolutionary processes often occur at the same timescale which may allow them to interact as a new field ecoevolutionary dynamics faces some important challenges first the field is primarily driven by theoretical research and empirical work on organisms with simple short life cycles typically animals and mostly performed under controlled conditions secondly it is unclear whether interactions between ecology and evolution are driven through a few common mechanisms or whether all interactions are context dependent thirdly there is a lack of ecoevolutionary research at higher organizational levels eg ecosystem and landscape although it is at those levels that the impact of evolution on our greatest conservation challenges may be most acute finally it remains unclear how genetic diversity impacts ecoevolutionary dynamics although the strong relationships between additive genetic variance fitness and the speed of evolution

international policy processes have created a wealth of indicators over the last two decades however genetic diversity indicators are regrettably absent from comprehensive biomonitoring schemes here we provide a review and an assessment of the different attempts made to provide such indicators for tree genetic diversity from the global level down to the level of the management unit so far no generally accepted indicators have been provided as international standards nor tested for their possible use in practice we suggest that indicators for monitoring genetic diversity and dynamics should be based on ecological and demographic surrogates of adaptive diversity as well as genetic markers capable of identifying genetic erosion and gene flow a comparison of past and present genecological distributions patterns of genetic variation of key adaptive traits in the ecological space of selected species is a realistic way of assessing the trend of intraspecific variation and thus provides a state indicator of tree genetic diversity also able to reflect possible pressures threatening genetic diversity revealing benefits of genetic diversity related to ecosystem services is complex but current trends in plantation performance offer the possibility of an indicator of benefit response indicators are generally much easier to define because recognition and even quantification of eg research education breeding conservation and regulation actions and programs are relatively straightforward only state indicators can reveal genetic patterns and processes which are fundamental for maintaining genetic diversity indirect indicators of pressure benefit or response should therefore not be used independently of state indicators a coherent set of indicators covering diversityproductivityknowledgemanagement based on the genecological approach is proposed for application on appropriate groups of tree species in the wild and in cultivation worldwide these indicators realistically reflect the state trends and potentials of the worlds tree genetic resources to support sustainable growth the state of the genetic diversity will be based on trends in population distributions and diversity patterns for selected species the productivity of the genetic resource of trees in current use will reflect the possible potential of mobilizing the resource

new drug candidate © 2015 botanical society of sao paulo we examined the genetic diversity and structure in populations of the endangered grassland herb vincetoxicum atratum using 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci although the populations were small and disconnected our molecular data indicated that the species maintains relatively high levels of genetic diversity and connectivity among populations population clustering analyses detected 2 to 3 clusters and most of the populations of v atratum comprised admixture of these genetic clusters these admixtures likely formed during the process of colonizing habitats that had been disturbed by human activities however structure clustering detected lowadmixtures in populations occurring in rocky maritime sites which may not be suitable for agriculture rangeland activities high genetic diversity and population connectivity suggested that loss of the remaining populations by grassland reduction might be an immediate threat for this species small grasslands populations managed by local farmers need appropriate conservation practices although our results showed genetic diversity and gene flow among populations of v

critical need to understand reproduction and gene flow across plant populations plant size conspecific density and local kinship ie neighbourhood genetic relatedness have been proposed as important mechanisms influencing the reproductive success of flowering plants but have rarely been simultaneously investigated methods we conducted this study on a continuous population of the understorey tree miconia affinis in the forest dynamics plot on barro colorado island in central panama we used spatial reproductive and population genetic data to investigate the effects of tree size conspecific neighbourhood density and local kinship on maternal and paternal reproductive success we used a bayesian framework to simultaneously model the effects of our explanatory variables on the mean and variance of maternal viable seed set and siring success key results our results reveal that large trees had lower proportions of viable seeds in their fruits but sired more seeds we documented differential effects of neighbourhood density and local kinship on both maternal and paternal reproductive components trees in more dense neighbourhoods produced on average more viable seeds although this positive density effect was influenced by varianceinflation with increasing local kinship neighbourhood density did not have significant effects on siring success conclusions this study is one of the first to reveal an interaction among tree size conspecific density and local kinship as critical factors differentially influencing maternal and paternal reproductive success we show that both maternal and paternal reproductive success should be evaluated to determine the populationlevel and individual traits most essential for plant reproduction in addition to conserving large trees we suggest the inclusion of small trees and the conservation of dense patches with low kinship as potential strategies for strengthening the reproductive status of tropical trees © 2015 the author 2015 the clonal diversity and clonal structure of a fargesia qinlingensis population densely distributed in foping national nature reserve were analyzed by simple sequence repeat ssr fingerprints we aimed

protection of giant pandas in all 81 ssr primers were designed of which 7 pairs with good stability high polymorphism and specificity for our research were selected for the 142 sampled ramets these 7 ssr primers generated a total of 79 valid loci of which 77 97 47 were polymorphic we successfully genotyped 107 clones among the 142 sampled ramets the largest single clone may cover a spatial distance of approximately 5 m this species showed a high clonal diversity with the proportion of distinguishable genotypes gn simpson’s index of diversity d average size of genotypes ng and fager’s

diversity d  0 62 proportion of distinguishable genotypes gn  0 17 and fager’s evenness e  0 68 analysis of clonal structure demonstrated that the spatial distribution pattern of f qinlingensis exhibited a phalanx growth strategy at the ramet level in contrast with our results that showed ramets belonging to the same clone were closely aggregated and formed distinct clumps at the 1 m x 1 m sample scale and clones were juxtaposed at the 5 m x 5 m sample scale although unweighted pairgroup method analysis upgma demonstrated no distinct clusters of clones the clones in the same plot were always classified into the same clade spatial autocorrelation analysis showed the spatial autocorrelation coefficients were 0 0840 626 and 0 0240 288 at the ramet and genet levels respectively this result indicated a significantly stronger spatial autocorrelation at the ramet level than at the genet level for f qinlingensis within a spatial distance of 36 m which implied that in spite of pollen flow might extend the spatial genetic structure clonal propagation made a certain restriction of the spatial genetic structure the autocorrelation coefficient was significantly positive within the distance of 44 m at the ramet level and the xintercept representing the average minimum length of irregular clone was 52 280 m in addition the largest spatial autocorrelation coefficient was 0 626 at 4 m which suggested that ramets within 4 m most likely belonged to the same clone it also implies that a sampling scale of 4 m shows a more distinct clonal structure than that of 5 m furthermore we detected significant negative autocorrelation from 56 m to 116 m but no significantvalues were detected beyond 120 m at the genet level the autocorrelation coefficient was significantly positive within the distance of 36 m significantly negative from 56 m to 104 m but showed no significant autocorrelation from 36 m to 56 m and beyond 108 m our results revealed that clonal diversity and clonal structure could be affected by initial seeding recruitment pollen dispersal and heterogeneity of microenvironment a relatively larger sample size and a more reasonable sample strategy would be

size of bumblebee populations between higher level stewardship hls farms implementing pollinatorfriendly schemes and entry level stewardship els control farms bumblebee abundance on the transect walks was significantly higher on hls farms than els farms molecular analysis suggested maximum foraging ranges of 566 m for bombus hortorum 714 m for b lapidarius 363 m for b pascuorum and 799 m for b

rare species by its more common congener is considered to become an issue of growing importance in conservation biology due to the fact that an increasing human impact on natural habitats and changes in climatic conditions will lead to higher frequencies of hybrid formation by shifting distributions andor phenologies in order to judge the future trajectories of hybridising plant species which could eventually lead to the loss of taxonomic biodiversity it is necessary to discern scenarios that lead to a complete merging of two species from those where hybridisation is an intermediary stage towards the establishment of reproductively isolated entities we present a populationgenomic approach that may allow discriminating between these two scenarios by estimating the strength of divergent selection regimes in hybrid swarms along ecological gradients using aflp fingerprinting 196 individuals from 11 populations of senecio hercynicus and s ovatus along an elevational transect 7501300m in the bavarian forest national park were genotyped for 634 anonymous loci based on bayesian cluster algorithms all populations were identified as being hybrid swarms with different admixture proportions of both parental genotypes indicating the intense introgressive hybridisation realised in this hybrid zone searching for loci under selection by using either finfstinfbased or logistic regression modelbased techniques resulted in the identification of only few aflp markers under selection which showed a significant correlation with some climatic variables along the transect the simultaneous finding however that speciesspecific markers were not among these selected markers support the interpretation that there is no climatically mediated divergent selection or reinforcement process going on that could reestablish genetically isolated biological species © 2014 elsevier gmbh one of the prominent compositional features of thermophilous deciduous forests of southern europe is their

and their regulatory networks in soybean cotyledons we sequenced 292 million small rna reads expressed in soybean cotyledons and discovered 130 novel mirna genes and 72 novel mirna families the cotyledon mirnas arose at various stages of land plant evolution evolutionary analysis of the mirna genes in duplicated genome segments from the recent glycine whole genome duplication revealed that the majority of novel soybean cotyledon mirnas were young and likely arose after the duplication event 13 million years ago we revealed the evolutionary pathway of a soybean cotyledon mirna family soymir1549 that evolved from a neutral invertase gene through an inverted duplication and a series of dna amplification and deletion events a total of 304 mirna genes were expressed in soybean cotyledons the mirnas were predicted to target 1910 genes and form complex mirna networks regulating a wide range of biological pathways in cotyledons the comprehensive characterization of the mirnas and their underlying regulatory networks at gene pathway and system levels provides a foundation for further studies of mirnas in cotyledons the fragmentation of natural forests has reduced the size

provenance and progeny test of balfourodendron riedelianum  the field trial was established at the pederneiras experimental station forestry institute of the state of são paulo the experimental design was a compact family block with 46 openpollinated progenies originating from three natural populations 13 progenies from alvorada do sulpr 16 from galiasp and 17 from bauru sp six replicates and five plants per subplot spaced at 3 x 3 m the test was assessed at the age of 27 years and estimates of genetic parameters were obtained using the method of additive univariate linear mixed model remlblup significant differences were detected by the likelihood ratio test in the analysis of deviance of provenances for all traits the coefficient of heritability at progeny means level varied from moderate to high for all traits 038 to 063 indicating that much of the phenotypic variation among the progenies tested is of genetic origin this suggests the possibility of improving the means of the offspring of the trees of this population through the selection among progenies the proportion of selection of 60 of the trees for the dbh trait using the index of multieffect showed small gains at provenance levels the results also suggest that the seeds collected in the proposed seed orchard will cause small increase in the dbh mean due to the low estimates of the genetic gains naturalresource managers and other conservation practitioners are under unprecedented pressure to categorize and quantify the vulnerability of natural systems based on assessment of the exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity of species to climate change despite the urgent need for these assessments neither the theoretical basis of adaptive capacity nor the practical issues underlying its quantification has been articulated in a manner that is directly applicable to naturalresource management both are critical for researchers managers and other conservation practitioners to develop reliable strategies for assessing adaptive capacity drawing from principles of classical and contemporary research and examples from terrestrial marine plant and animal systems we examined broadly the theory behind the concept of adaptive capacity we then considered how interdisciplinary trait and triagebased approaches encompassing the oftoverlooked interactions among components of adaptive capacity can be used to identify species and populations likely to have higher or lower adaptive capacity we identified the challenges and value of such endeavors and argue for a concerted interdisciplinary research approach that combines ecology ecological genetics and ecophysiology to reflect the interacting components of adaptive capacity we aimed to provide a basis for constructive discussion between naturalresource managers and researchers discussions urgently needed to identify research directions that will deliver answers to realworld questions facing resource managers other conservation practitioners and policy makers directing research to both seek general patterns and identify ways to facilitate adaptive capacity of key species and populations within species will enable conservation ecologists and

exist throughout land plants including earlydiverging species lacking true roots suggesting that earlyevolving arabidillos had additional biological roles here we investigated using molecular genetics the conservation and diversification of arabidillo protein function in plants separated by c 450 million years of evolution we demonstrate that arabidillo homologues in the moss physcomitrella patens regulate a previously undiscovered inhibitory effect of abscisic acid aba on spore germination furthermore we show that a thaliana arabidillos function similarly during seed germination earlydiverging arabidillo homologues from both p patens and the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii can substitute for arabidillo function during a thaliana root development and seed germination we conclude that 1

conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the wollemi pine genome in this study we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the w nobilis chloroplast genome a detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the araucariaceae and the related family podocarpaceae pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences and the presence of unique pseudogenes gene duplications and insertions in w nobilis and araucariaceae indicate that the w nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon agathis however the w nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences and these could be used in future studies

evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivatednaturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivatednaturalised groups with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis with three subclusters of indigenous populations the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary

swapping in dimer formation the two subunits in a dimer often show small differences in structure but the two domains not always related by 2fold symmetry have the same structure each domain carries three sugarbinding sites similar to those in plant lectins one on each greek key motif the occurrence of βprism ii fold lectins in bacteria with characteristics similar to those from plants indicates that this family of lectins is of ancient origin and had evolved into a mature system before bacteria and plants diverged in plants the number of binding sites per domain varies between one and three whereas the number is two in the recently reported lectin domains from pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa an analysis of the sequences of the lectins and the lectin domains shows that the level of sequence similarity among the three greek keys in each domain has a correlation with the number of binding sites in it furthermore sequence conservation among the lectins from different species is the highest for that greek key which carries a binding site in all of them thus it would appear that carbohydrate binding influences the course of the evolution of the lectin © the author

and postglacial periods on species distributions is key for predicting the effects of future environmental changes we investigated the influence of two physiographic landscapes on population structure and postglacial colonization of two white pine species of contrasting habitats p monticola which occurs in the highly mountainous region of western north america and p strobus which occurs in a much less mountainous area in eastern north america•
methods to characterize the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure across the ranges of both species 158 and 153 single nucleotide polymorphism snp markers derived from expressed genes were genotyped on rangewide samples of 61 p monticola and 133 p strobus populations respectively•
key results in p monticola a steep latitudinal decrease in genetic diversity likely resulted from postglacial colonization involving rare longdistance dispersal ldd events in contrast no geographic patterns of diversity were detected in p strobus suggesting recolonization via a gradually advancing front or frequent ldd events for each species structure analyses identified two distinct southern and northern genetic groups that likely originated from two different glacial lineages at a finer scale and for the two species smaller subgroups were detected that could be remnants of cryptic refugia•

in darkness to ubiquitinate several transcription factors involved in light responses thereby targeting them for degradation by the proteasome while cop1 is also found in humans spa proteins appear

in darkness and the leaf expansion defect of cop1 mutants while it partially restored normal photoperiodic flowering in cop1 physcomitrella cop1 partially restored normal seedling growth and flowering time while it fully restored normal leaf expansion in the cop1 mutants in contrast expression of a spa ortholog from physcomitrella ppspab in arabidopsis spa mutants did not rescue any facet of the

structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees this is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the tradeoff between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources we used field surveys molecular genetics and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20km2 agricultural landscape in southern england uk we investigated five species including the rare b ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread b hortorum we compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species bombus terrestris b lapidarius and b ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances 551 536 and 501 m respectively than b hortorum and b pascuorum 336 and 272 m respectively there was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation including managed agrienvironmental field margins the strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species for example the strongest relationship for b ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species there is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options such as agrienvironment schemes aimed at providing foraging

valley is setting of ancient and the currently most active management of s pruinosus we hypothesized tehuacán as the original area of domestication of s pruinosus and expected to find there its highest genetic variation and original source of genes of cultivated plants through nuclear microsatellite loci we studied spatial distribution of genetic variation and population differentiation we sampled wild and managed populations of the centralwestern tehuacán central valleys and tehuantepec oaxaca northeastern huasteca and southeastern chiapas regions differences among regions and populations were compared through homogeneity and exact test for fis  amova bayesian analysis and genetic barriers a niche analysis allowed corroborating taxonomic identity of populations the highest

regional groups differentiating one group formed by northern and southern populations and other formed by populations of the centralwestern region differences among groups suggested that populations from huasteca could be species different to s pruinosus but the niche analysis did not support such hypothesis populations from tehuantepec were different but genetically interconnected with those of tehuacán tehuantepec is the main reservoir of genetic diversity of wild populations of s pruinosus but tehuacán is the principal current area of domestication of s pruinosus and probably where its

many expression evolution studies characterized evolutionary forces acting on gene expression without explicit discrimination between global expression differences and tissue specific expression differences however different types of gene expression alteration should have different effects on an organism the evolutionary forces that act on them might be different and different types of genes might show different types of differential expression between species to confirm this we studied differentially expressed de genes among closely related groups that have extensive gene expression atlases and clarified characteristics of different types of de genes including the identification of regulating loci for differential expression using expression quantitative loci eqtl analysis data results we detected differentially expressed de genes between rice subspecies in five homologous tissues that were verified using japonica and indica transcriptome atlases in public databases using the transcriptome atlases we classified de genes into two types global de genes and changedtissues de genes global type de genes were not expressed in any tissues in the atlas of one subspecies however changedtissues type de genes were expressed in both subspecies with different tissue specificity for the five tissues in the two japonicaindica combinations 46 ± 08 and 59 ± 15  of highly expressed genes were global and changedtissues de genes respectively changedtissues de genes varied in number between tissues increasing linearly with the abundance of tissue specifically expressed genes in the tissue molecular evolution of global de genes was rapid unlike that of changedtissues de genes based on gene ontology global and changedtissues de genes were different having no common go terms expression differences of most global de genes were regulated by ciseqtls expression evolution of changedtissues de genes was rapid in tissue specifically expressed genes and those rapidly evolved changedtissues de genes were regulated not by ciseqtls but by complicated transeqtls conclusions global de genes and changedtissues de genes had contrasting characteristics the two contrasting types of de genes provide possible explanations for the previous controversial conclusions about the relationships between molecular evolution and expression evolution of genes in different species

the use of a combination of molecular techniques was a highly efficient method of estimating genetic variability levels among tunisian ryegrass germplasm in summary results showed that combining molecular and morphoagronomical markers is an efficient way in assessing the genetic variability among tunisian ryegrass genotypes in addition the combined analysis provided an exhaustive coverage for

about which there are not too many studies from the genetics point of view the study was conducted in an area of 22 hectares located in the conservation unit managed by the forest institute of the state of são paulo brazil assis state forest total genomic dna of 300 seeds from 25 plants 12 seeds from each plant was extracted and amplified using specific primers to obtain microsatellite markers results showed that selfing is frequent among adults and progenies and the species reproduces by outcrossing between related and unrelated individuals 0913 the singlelocus outcrossing rate was 0632 which indicates that mating between unrelated individuals is more frequent than between related plants the selfing rate was low 0087 that is the species is allogamous and selffertilization is reduced about 35 of the plants in the progenies were fullsibs and about 57 halfsibs besides about 8 of the progenies were selfing siblings the genetic differentiation coefficient within progenies was 0139

number of species understanding the natural history of these species is important for designing conservation strategies such as habitat enhancements or exsitu conservation the acquisition of observational data may be difficult for rare and declining species but metagenomics and metabarcoding can provide novel kinds of information here we use these methods for analysing fecal samples from an endangered population of a colobine primate the banded leaf monkey presbytis femoralis results we conducted metagenomics via shotgun sequencing on six fecal samples obtained from a remnant population of p femoralis in a speciesrich rainforest patch in singapore shotgun sequencing and identification against a plant barcode reference database reveals a broad dietary profile consisting of at least 53 plant species from 33 families the diet includes exotic plant species and is broadly consistent with  2 years of observational data metagenomics identified 15 of the 24 plant genera for which there is observational data but also revealed at least 36 additional species dna traces for the diet species were recovered and identifiable in the feces despite long digestion times and a large number of potential food plants within the rainforest habitat 700 species we also demonstrate that metagenomics provides greater taxonomic resolution of food plant species by utilizing multiple genetic markers as compared to singlemarker metabarcoding in addition full mitochondrial genomes of p femoralis individuals were reconstructed from fecal metagenomic shotgun reads showing very low levels of genetic diversity in the focal population and the presence of gut parasites could also be confirmed metagenomics thus allows for the simultaneous assessment of diet population genetics and gut parasites based on fecal samples conclusions our study demonstrates that metagenomic shotgun sequencing of fecal samples can be successfully used to rapidly obtain natural history data for

wiley  sons ltd identification and characterization of the farmers’ named crop varieties cultivated around the world is a major issue for conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources intraspecific diversity is strongly determined by farmers’ sociocultural environment but this has little been documented in this paper we tested on a contact zone among three ethnolinguistic groups located on the mount kenya region whether farmers’ sociocultural differences have an impact on the morphological characteristics of the farmers’ named sorghum varieties eighteen qualitative morphological traits of the panicles were measured we first compared the morphological diversity of the named varieties among ethnolinguistic groups using multivariate analysis of homogeneity of groups’ dispersion and tested their differentiation using permutational multivariate analysis of variance discriminant analysis of principal components was then used to categorize the morphological diversity without a priori and this classification was compared with farmers’ local taxonomy vernacular names in the three ethnolinguistic groups our results show that some morphotypes are peculiar to some ethnolinguistic groups and that a morphotype can bear different variety names while the same variety name can be used to identify different morphotypes morphological differentiation that was explained by ethnolinguistic groups was higher for local landraces than for improved varieties our findings imply that sociocultural diversity of farmers and the criteria they use to identify and maintain landraces need to be considered in studying and sampling crop diversity for in situ as well as for ex situ conservation copyright © niab 2016 background home gardens hgs provide perspectives

especially in westafrica where food insecurity is acute this is critical to ensure effective mainstreaming of hgs into future biodiversity conservation and food production policies methods socioeconomic and pd data were obtained from individual interviews n  470 and gardens inventories n  235 spanning humid subhumid and semiarid zones of benin generalised linear models hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis and simple correspondence analysis were performed to examine socioeconomic characteristics age gender education level and main economic activity affecting hgs ownership and their effect coupled with intrinsic hgs characteristics size age on pd and structure within hgs across contrasting biogeographical regions results hg ownership was significantly dependent upon a complex relationship between age gender and education level of the farmers the probability to own hg increased with age with an early involvement in home gardening for women similarly with increasing age it was more likely to find a male owner than a female owner among the uneducated informants and those of primary school inversely it was more likely to find female owner than a male owner among secondary school level or more pd increased with increasing owner age and size of the hg larger and more diversified hgs were found in subhumid and semiarid zones while smaller and less diversified hgs were encountered in the humid zone hgs were multilayered based on the prevailing plant groups three categories of hg were distinguished herb based gardens herb and shrubtrees based gardens and palm and liana based gardens their prevalence was dependent upon biogeographical zones and hg owner socioeconomic characteristics with herbs based hgs being mainly associated to women conclusion results suggest effects of complex interactions between socioeconomic factors on hg ownership and influence of these effects combined with intrinsic characteristics of hgs on pd the early involvement of women in home gardening and their particular interest in herbs and shrubs are important assets for future conservation strategies based on hg and food production interventions are

to seed composition during seed filling in oilseed rape brassica napus however the mechanism underlying this heat response is poorly understood in this study global transcription profiles of 20 dold siliques of b napus were analyzed after heat stress using a brassica 95k est microarray the upregulated genes included many hsfhsp transcripts and other heatrelated marker genes such as rof2 dreb2a mbf1c and hsa32 reflecting the conservation of key heat resistance factors among plants other upregulated genes were preferentially expressed in heatstressed silique walls or seeds including some transcription factors and potential developmental regulators in contrast downregulated genes differed between the silique wall and seeds and were largely tied to the biological functions of each tissue such as glucosinolate metabolism in the silique wall and flavonoid synthesis in seeds additionally a large proportion onethird of these differentially expressed genes had unknown functions based on these gene expression profiles arabidopsis mutants for eight heatinduced brassica homologous genes were treated with different heat stress methods and thermotolerance varied with each mutation heat stress regimen and plant development stage at least two of the eight mutants exhibited sensitivity to the heat treatments suggesting the importance of the respective genes in responding to heat stress in summary this study elucidated the molecular bases of the heat responses in siliques during later reproductive stages and provides valuable information and gene resources for the

the flower a structure characteristic of the angiosperms in flowering plants sexual reproduction depends notably on the development of the gynoecium that produces and protects the ovules in arabidopsis thaliana ovule initiation is promoted by the concerted action of auxin with cuc1 cupshaped cotyledon1 and cuc2 two genes that encode transcription factors of the nac family namataf12cuc here we highlight an additional role for cuc2 and cuc3 in arabidopsis thaliana ovule separation while cuc1 and cuc2 are broadly expressed in the medial tissue of the gynoecium cuc2 and cuc3 are expressed in the placental tissue between developing ovules consistent with the partial overlap between cuc1 cuc2 and cuc3 expression patterns we show that cuc proteins can physically interact both in yeast cells and in planta we found that the cuc2cuc3 double mutant specifically harbours defects in ovule separation producing fused seeds that share the seed coat and suggesting that cuc2 and cuc3 promote ovule separation in a partially redundant manner functional analyses show that cuc transcription factors are also involved in ovule development in cardamine hirsuta additionally we show a conserved expression pattern of cuc orthologues between ovule primordia in other phylogenetically distant species with different gynoecium architectures taken together these results suggest an ancient role for cuc transcription factors in ovule separation and shed light on the conservation of mechanisms involved in the development of innovative structures © 2015 john wiley  sons ltd rust fungi are

relationships would decline under predicted environmental change scenarios whereas others would either remain unchanged or become more prevalent notably some graminicolous rusts are negatively affected by higher temperatures and increased concentrations of atmospheric co2 an increase of atmospheric o3 appears to favour rust diseases on trees but not those on grasses combined effects of co2

by the us food and drug administration fda or europe and also newer therapeutic agents to treat osteoporosis according to the clinical trial data available at pubmed uptodate international osteoporosis foundation iof and clinical practice guidelines as well the effect of combination therapy and recommendations for future research will be further discussed
background prevalence of osteoporosis is increasing both in developed and developing countries due to rapid growth in the burden and cost of osteoporosis worldwide it seems reasonable to focus on the reduction of fractures as the main goal of treatment although efficient pharmacological agents are available for the treatment of osteoporosis there still remains a need to more specific drugs with less adverse effects
short conclusion the use of current antiresorptive and anabolic agents alone or in combinations for the treatment of osteoporosis entails several limitations mainly their efficacy on nonvertebral fracture reduction is lower than that observed on vertebral fracture in addition they have potential adverse events on long time usage development of newer agents such as cathepsin k inhibitor and strontium ranelate not only have increased the available options for treating osteoporosis but also have opened doors of opportunity to improvements in the effective treatment however the high cost of new agents have restricted their usage in selective patients who are at high risk of fracture or whom failed response to first line treatment options thus personalized medicine should be considered for future evaluation of genetic risk score and also for environmental exposure assessment in addition to permanent attention to early diagnosis of osteoporosis and understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis for novel approach in drug discovery there seems a need to more welldesigned clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer duration on current as well as on newer agents also continuous research on plantderived components as the source of discovering new agents and conducting more clinical trials with combination of two or more synthetic drugs plants or drugplant for the treatment of osteoporosis are recommended summary of treatment modalities for osteoporosis when nonnative genetically diverse species are introduced hybridization with native

exist on ecologically important tree species in the genus platanus introgressive hybridization is widespread and one common ornamental species introduced to california during the late 19th century is itself a hybrid our microsatellite analysis of more than 400 platanus trees from northcentral california reveals a complex pattern of invasion and hybridization in an agestructured population by using size as a proxy for age we have demonstrated that the platanus population of northcentral california has recently gained genetic diversity and effective population size principal coordinate analysis pcoa and genetic admixture analysis structure both reveal a strong differentiation of genotypes into two main genetic clusters with a large number of admixed genotypes one of the genetic clusters identified is heavily biased towards younger trees including samples from locations with relatively recently planted ornamental trees likely to be p × hispanica formerly known as p × acerifolia we conclude that the two genetic clusters correspond to the native p racemosa and the introduced invasive hybrid species p × hispanica additional hybridization between the invasive ornamental and the native species has occurred in california and recent hybrid trees are more likely to be younger than trees without admixture our findings suggest that the observed increase in genetic diversity among california platanus is due to rampant ongoing introgression which may be threatening the continued genetic distinctiveness of the native species this is cause for concern from a conservation standpoint due to a direct loss of genetic distinctiveness and a potential reduction in habitat value of associated species © 2016 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht genome sequencing of

p450s across the p450 families with the exception of p450s of phanerochaete chrysosporium and phanerochaete carnosa suggesting paralogous evolution of p450s in model basidiomycetes p450 genestructure analysis revealed high conservation in the size of exons and the location of introns p450s with the same gene structure were found tandemly arranged in the genomes of selected fungi this clearly suggests that extensive gene duplications particularly tandem gene duplications led to the enrichment of selective p450 families in basidiomycetes functional analysis and gene expression profiling

is a valuable genetic resource worldwide however knowledge of the genetic constitution and variability levels of the argentinean germplasm is still scarce rendering the global map of cultivated sunflower diversity incomplete in this study 42 microsatellite loci and 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps were used to characterize the first association mapping population used for quantitative trait loci mapping in sunflower along with a selection of allied openpollinated and composite populations from the germplasm bank of the national institute of agricultural technology of argentina the ability of different kinds of markers to assess genetic diversity and population structure was also evaluated
results the analysis of polymorphism in the set of sunflower accessions studied here showed that both the microsatellites and snp markers were informative for germplasm characterization although to different extents in general the estimates of genetic variability were moderate the average genetic diversity as quantified by the expected heterozygosity was 052 for ssr loci and 029 for snps within ssr markers those derived from noncoding regions were able to capture higher levels of diversity than estssr a significant correlation was found between ssr and snp based genetic distances among accessions bayesian and multivariate methods were used to infer population structure evidence for the existence of three different genetic groups was found consistently across data sets ie ssr snp and ssr  snp with the maintainerrestorer status being the most prevalent characteristic associated with group delimitation
conclusion the present study constitutes the first report comparing the performance of ssr and snp markers for population genetics analysis in cultivated sunflower we show that the ssr and snp panels examined here either used separately or in conjunction allowed consistent estimations of genetic diversity and population structure in sunflower breeding materials the generated knowledge about the levels of diversity and population structure of sunflower germplasm is an important contribution to this crop breeding and conservation ni vavilov’s theories direct presentday global activities in plant science breeding and conservation his expeditions around the world located centers of diversity of crop evolution vavilov was one of the earliest scientists to realize that wild genetic diversity could be lost through genetic erosion reducing the possibilities for future crop improvement to measure genetic erosion gary nabhan and colleagues traveled in 11 countries following routes that vavilov had taken more than half a century before the detailed notes concerning the vegetation and flora that vavilov observed could be used as a baseline in contrast with nabhan’s plant and cultivar inventories to observe changes in plant diversity at specific sites the objective of this manuscript is to summarize potential genetic erosion at three case study locations the pamiri highlands of tajikistan the ethiopian highlands and the colorado plateau of southwestern north america at these localities vavilov’s notes can be compared with the agricultural activities of the modern day in each case significant climatic environmental and humancaused changes have affected the local agriculture during the intervening years localities that have retained diversity have suffered the least reduction of diversity is associated with decreased agricultural stability and productivity programs encouraging farmers to manage diversity and promote involvement of local youth

aphid causes severe systemic damage symptoms in wheat barley and other small grains as a direct result of the salivary proteins it injects into the plant while feeding results we sequenced and de novo assembled the genome of d noxia biotype 2 the strain most virulent to resistance genes in wheat the assembled genomic scaffolds span 393mb equivalent to 93 of its 421mb genome and contains 19097 genes d noxia has the most atrich insect genome sequenced to date 709 with a bimodal cpginfoeinf distribution and a complete set of methylation related genes the d noxia genome displays a widespread extensive reduction in the number of genes per ortholog group including defensive detoxification chemosensory and sugar transporter groups in comparison to the acyrthosiphon pisum genome including a 65 reduction in chemoreceptor genes thirty of 34 known d noxia salivary genes were found in this assembly these genes exhibited less homology with those salivary genes commonly expressed in insect saliva such as glucose dehydrogenase and trehalase yet greater conservation among genes that are expressed in d noxia saliva but not detected in the saliva of other insects genes involved in insecticide activity and endosymbiontderived genes were also found as well as genes involved in virus transmission although d noxia is not a viral vector conclusions this genome is the second sequenced aphid genome and the first of a phytotoxic insect d noxias reduced gene content of may reflect the influence of phytotoxic feeding in shaping the d noxia genome and in turn in broadening its host range the presence of methylationrelated genes including cytosine methylation is consistent with other parthenogenetic and polyphenic insects the d noxia genome will provide an important contrast

substantial pressure on the agricultural production system agricultural production demands are expected to increase in the twentyfirst century with demands for cereals in particular expected to rise by 70  from 2007 to 2050 fao 2012 besides the need of biomass for bioenergy and biorefineries is also expected to increase considerably there are however fewer possibilities to increase the area under agriculture substantially for enhancing production systems in the world global climate change is also going to affect the production potential more adversely mainly due to increase in temperatures which in terms reduce the photosynthetic capacity of important agricultural crop plants further water is expected to become a limiting factor in most of areas and the pressure from devastating pathogens and pests is also assumed to increase substantially however challenges of meeting future cereal production demands as mentioned above will be entirely dependent on the development of potential cultivars well adapted to the altered growing conditions the tailoring of genetically potential crop varieties with high and stable yield adequate quality attributes and low environment impact will in turn be dependent on the available invaluable wildweedy genetic resources and their subsequent selection and utilization for diversification of cultivated gene pool gene banks across

of crop wild relatives there is considerable germplasm availability of cereals including collections of adapted varieties and genetic stocks carrying useful traits of interest through to landraces and crop wild relatives however this richness of plant genetic diversity is greatly underutilized with important traits not being exploited into the cultivated genetic background the conservation of

and it includes several species of the vitis genus the primary mission of this facility is the longterm conservation of a broad spectrum of wine and table grape cultivars as well as grape rootstock both commercially used and not the collection also includes various biotypes representative of existing intravarietal genetic variability identified during the clonal selection programs specific objectives include the acquisition maintenance characterization evaluation documentation and distribution of grapevine germplasm the accessions are maintained ex situ in field collections and partially in vitro the plants are characterized and evaluated on the basis of morphological physiological biochemical genetic and agronomical characteristics the collected accessions display a very wide phenotypic variability for many characters eg shape and size of the leaves and bunches colour shape and size of the berries presence of seeds berry skin thickness sugar accumulation phenological periods susceptibility to various pathogens etc selected nuclear simple sequence repeats ssr markers are routinely used for dna fingerprinting of the whole collection to determine accession redundancy and to identify synonyms homonyms and mislabeling the germplasm collection provides a valuable source of genes potentially useful in grapevine genetic improvement programmes moreover the collection

of several vertebrate plant and fungal lineages earlier studies have focused on establishing when these events occurred and on elucidating their functional and evolutionary consequences but we still lack sufficient understanding of how genome duplications first originated we used phylogenomics to study the ancient genome duplication occurred in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae lineage and found compelling evidence for the existence of a contemporaneous interspecies hybridization we propose that the genome doubling was a direct consequence of this hybridization and that it served to provide stability to the recently formed allopolyploid this scenario provides a mechanism for the origin of this ancient duplication and the lineage that originated from it and brings a new perspective to the

important to plant development and agricultural production barley and rice diverged 50 million years ago but share a similar germination process to gain insight into the conservation of their underlying gene regulatory programs we compared transcriptomes of barley and rice at start middle and end points of germination and revealed that germination regulated barley and rice genes brs diverged significantly in expression patterns andor protein sequences however brs with higher protein sequence similarity tended to have more conserved expression patterns we identified and characterized 316 sets of conserved barley and rice genes cbrs with high similarity in both protein sequences and expression patterns and provided a comprehensive depiction of the transcriptional regulatory program conserved in barley and rice germination at gene pathway and systems levels the cbrs encoded proteins involved in a variety of biological pathways and had a wide range of expression patterns the cbrs encoding key regulatory components in signaling pathways often had diverse expression patterns early germination upregulation of cell wall metabolic pathway and peroxidases and late germination upregulation of chromatin structure and remodeling pathways were conserved in both barley and rice protein sequence and expression pattern of a gene change quickly if it is not subjected to a functional constraint preserving germinationregulated expression patterns and protein sequences of those cbrs for 50 million years strongly suggests that the cbrs are functionally significant and equivalent in germination and contribute to the ancient characteristics of germination preserved in barley and rice the functional significance and equivalence of the cbr genes predicted here can serve as a foundation to further characterize their biological functions and facilitate bridging rice and barley germination research with greater confidence argonaute ago proteins are important effectors in rna silencing pathways but they must interact with other machinery to trigger silencing ago hooks have emerged as a conserved motif responsible for interaction with ago proteins but little is known about the sequence surrounding ago hooks that must restrict or enable interaction with specific argonautes here we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of an agobinding platform in nrpe1 the largest subunit of rna polymerase v we compared nrpe1 sequences from  50 species including dense sampling of two plant lineages this study demonstrates that the agobinding platform of nrpe1 retains ago hooks intrinsic disorder and repetitive character while being highly labile at the sequence level we reveal that loss of sequence conservation is the result of relaxed selection and frequent expansions and contractions of tandem repeat arrays these factors allow a complete restructuring of the agobinding platform over 50–60 million yr this evolutionary pattern is also detected in a second agobinding platform suggesting it is a general mechanism the presence of labile repeat arrays in all analyzed nrpe1 agobinding platforms indicates that selection maintains repetitive

and that differences between species arise through divergence later in development this high conservation during middevelopment is illustrated by the waist of the hourglass and it represents a low probability of evolutionary change earlier molecular surveys both on animals and on plants have shown that the genes expressed at the waist stage are more ancient and more conserved in their expression the existence of such a developmental hourglass has not been explored in fungi another eukaryotic kingdom in this study we generated a series of transcriptomic data covering the entire lifecycle of a model mushroomforming fungus coprinopsis cinerea and we observed a molecular hourglass over its development the young fruiting body is the stage that expresses the evolutionarily oldest lowest transcriptome age index transcriptome and gives the strongest signal of purifying selection lowest transcriptome divergence index we also demonstrated that all three kingdoms  animals plants and fungi  display high expression levels of genes in information storage and processing at the waist stages whereas the genes in metabolism become more highly expressed later besides the three kingdoms all show underrepresented signal transduction mechanisms at the waist stages the synchronic existence of a molecular hourglass across the three kingdoms reveals a mutual strategy for

gene regulation during plant development previous studies revealed that some mirnas are highly shared by most land plants recently the liverwort marchantia polymorpha has been studied by molecular genetic approaches and sequencing of its genome is currently underway the expression pattern and the detailed functions ofmirnas during marchantia development are unknown here we profiled the small rnas expressed in thalli antheridiophores and archegoniophores of m polymorpha using highthroughput rna sequencing we revealed that a limited number of mirnas are shared between m polymorpha and the moss physcomitrella patens and that a number of mirnas are m polymorpha specific like other land plants cognate target genes corresponding to conserved mirnas could be found in the genome database and were experimentally confirmed to guide cleavage of target mrnas the results suggested that two genes in the spl squamosa promoter bindinglike transcription factor family which are regulated by mir156 in most land plants were instead targeted by two distinct mirnas in m polymorpha in order to demonstrate the physiological roles of mirnas in m polymorpha we constructed an mirna ectopic expression system to establish overexpression transformants for conserved mirnas mir166 and mir319 ectopic expression of these mirnas induced abnormal development of the thallus and gemma cups suggesting that

were designed using mpprimer14 software uniplex or multiplexpcr protocol had produced amplicons of 156 557 and 287 bp length respectively for camv 35s promoter nptii gene and βfructofuranosidase primers presence of 287 bp fragment for endogenous reference gene and absence of other two fragments for specific transgene elements in conserved germplasm indicated the absence of transgenes in germplasm being conserved in national genebank presence of βfructofuranosidase gene in most of the crop plants justifies its use for screening germplasm across species against transgene flow it would be very much useful in screening germplasm towards conservation for which transgenic counterparts with camv 35s promoter and nptii gene are available at present multiplexpcr protocol was validated for the risk of transgene flow using eggplant germplasms which are being conserved since 2008 at our national genebank implementing validated screening protocol for transgene detection as one of the major preparatory measures before conserving germplasm in genebanks will help curators in checking unintentional transgene flow in this report we characterized the arabidopsisabi1 gene orthologue and brassica napus gene paralogues encoding protein phosphatase 2c pp2c group a which is known to be a negative regulator of the aba signaling pathway six homologous b napus sequences were identified and characterized as putative pp2c group a members to gain insight into the conservation of abi1 function in brassicaceae and understand better its regulatory effects in the drought stress response we generated transgenic b napus plants overexpressing a thalianaabi1 transgenic plants subjected to drought showed a decrease in relative water content photosynthetic pigments content and expression level of rab18 and rd19adroughtresponsive marker genes relative to wt plants we present the characterization of the drought response of b napus with the participation of abi1like paralogues the expression pattern of two evolutionarily distant paralogues bnaa01abi1a and bnac07abi1b in b napus and their promoter activity in a thaliana showed differences in the induction of the paralogues under dehydration stress comparative sequence analysis of both bnaabi1 promoters showed variation in positions of cisacting elements that are especially important for aba and stressinducible expression together these data reveal that subfunctionalization following gene duplication may be important in the maintenance and functional divergence of the bnaabi1 paralogues our results provide a framework for a better understanding of 1 the role of abi1 as a hub protein regulator of the drought response and 2 the differential involvement of the duplicated bnaabi1 genes in the response of b napus to

sptadagcn5acetyltransferase saga complex plays an important role in transcription regulation in eukaryotes however even in the advent of genome sequencing of various plants saga complex has been poorly defined for their components and roles in plant development and physiological functions computational analysis of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa genomes for saga complex resulted in the identification of 17 to 18 potential candidates for saga subunits we have further classified the saga complex based on the conserved domains phylogenetic analysis revealed that the saga complex proteins are evolutionary conserved between plants yeast and mammals functional annotation showed that they participate not only in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation but also in different biological processes which could be indirect and possibly mediated via the regulation of gene expression the in silico expression analysis of the saga components in arabidopsis and o sativa clearly indicates that its components have a distinct expression profile at different developmental stages the coexpression analysis of the saga components suggests that many of these subunits coexpress at different developmental stages during hormonal interaction and in response to stress conditions quantitative realtime pcr analysis of saga component genes further confirmed their expression in different plant tissues and stresses the expression of representative salt heat and light inducible genes were affected in mutant lines of saga subunits in arabidopsis altogether the present study

interactions among plants can increase species richness by relaxing environmental filters and providing more heterogeneous environments however it is not known if facilitation could affect coexistence through other mechanisms most studies on plant coexistence focus on negative frequencydependent mechanisms decreasing the abundance of common species here we test if facilitation can enhance coexistence by giving species an advantage when rare to test our hypothesis we used a global data set from drylands and alpine environments and measured the intensity of facilitation based on cooccurrences with nurse plants for 48 species present in at least 4 different sites and with a range of abundances in the field we compared these results with the degree of facilitation experienced by species which are globally rare or common according to the iucn red list and with a larger data base including over 1200 cooccurrences of target species with their nurses facilitation was stronger for rare species ie those having lower local abundances or considered endangered by the iucn than for common species and strongly decreased with the abundance of the facilitated species these results hold after accounting for the distance of each species from its ecological optimum ie the degree of functional stress it experiences synthesis our results highlight that nurse plants not only increase the number of species able to colonize a given site but may also promote species coexistence by preventing the local extinction of rare species our findings illustrate the role that nurse plants play in conserving endangered species and link the relationship between facilitation and diversity with coexistence theory as such they provide further mechanistic understanding on how facilitation

population of scots pine pinus sylvestris var nevadensis christ for this purpose we conducted controlled pollinations to obtain native exotic and intraspecific hybrid progenies for testing seed viability and seedling performance under experimental commongarden conditions mimicking the severe summer drought in the native populations environment proportion of aborted seeds was markedly higher in exotic  60 than in intraspecific hybrid 24 and native 18 progenies seed germination time and rate were similar across genetic crosses hybrid and exotic seedlings died on average 12 and 08 days earlier than local progenies when exposed to the drought treatment cumulative mortality rate was positively associated to biomass allocation in needles suggesting that higher investment in needles is maladaptive in dry environments for p sylvestris probably because of increased total transpiration native progenies harbored higher genetic variation than exotic progenies but similar to hybrids for most phenotypic traits suggesting low impact of exotic gene flow on the levels of heritable genetic variation of the relict population to the extent that our results held in natural conditions they suggest that natural selection in the relicts dry natural environment could potentially hamper the effective establishment of exotic genes via seed and pollen dispersal from the plantations and that exotic hybridization would not significantly affect the potential of early recruits in response to selection © 2015 elsevier bv since its development in the 1960s plant cryopreservation is considered an extraordinary method of safe longterm conservation of biological material as it does not induce genetic alterations and preserve the regeneration potential of the stored material it is based on the storage of explants at cryogenic temperatures such as the one of liquid nitrogen 196 °c where the metabolism within the cells is suspended thus the time for these cells is theoretically “stopped” cryopreservation is particularly important for embryogenic cultures as they require periodic subculturing for their maintenance and this in turn increases the risk of losing the material as well as its embryogenic potential periodic reinitiation of embryogenic cultures is possible however it is labor intensive expensive and particularly difficult when working with species for which embryogenic explants are available only during a limited period of the year among various methods of cryopreservation available for embryogenic cultures slow cooling is still the most common approach especially

we cloned three bip homologous cdna sequences in bread wheat triticum aestivum completed by rapid amplification of cdna ends race and examined the expression of wheat bip in wheat tissues particularly the relationship between bip expression and the subunit types of hmwgs using nearisogenic lines nils of hmwgs silencing and under abiotic stress results sequence analysis demonstrated that all bips contained three highly conserved domains present in plants animals and microorganisms indicating their evolutionary conservation among different biological species quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction qrtpcr revealed that tabip triticum aestivum bip expression was not organspecific but was predominantly localized to seed endosperm furthermore immunolocalization confirmed that tabip was primarily located within the protein bodies pbs in wheat endosperm three tabip genes exhibited significantly downregulated expression following high molecular weightglutenin subunit hmwgs silencing drought stress induced significantly upregulated expression of tabips in wheat roots leaves and developing grains conclusions the high conservation of bip sequences suggests that bip plays the same role or has common mechanisms in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptides and protein synthesis across species the expression of tabips in different wheat tissue and under abiotic stress indicated that tabip is most abundant in tissues with high secretory activity and with high proportions of cells undergoing division and that the expression level of bip is associated with the subunit types of hmwgs and synthesis the expression of tabips is developmentally regulated during seed development and early seedling growth and under

other data sets although different cisnat data sets have different prevalent cisnat topologies with respect to overlapping proteincoding genes a thaliana cisnats have substantial conservation 2835 in

picked for optimal discernment of purifying selection focussing on the parts of their sequences not overlapping proteincoding transcripts dubbed nolps we found significant nolp sequence conservation for 2834 nats across different cisnat sets this nat nolp sequence conservation versus a lyrata is generally significantly correlated with conservation of expression we discover a significant enrichment of transcription factor binding sites as evidenced by chipseq data in nolps compared to randomly sampled neargene nolplike dna  that is linked to significant sequence conservation conversely there is no such evidence for a general significant link between nolps and formation of small interfering rnas sirnas with the substantial majority of unique sirnas arising from the

those processes and that there was a response asynchrony between shallow and deep plants probably caused by the strong differences in the light environment the photochemical pathway of energy use was more effective in shallow plants due to higher light availability but these plants needed more investment in photoprotection and photorepair requiring higher translation and protein synthesis than

diversification we also evaluated woody species in contrast to herbaceous species the main climatic variable influencing phylogenetic pattern was precipitation in the driest quarter particularly for herbaceous species suggesting that environmental filtering related to minimal periods of precipitation is an important driver of caatinga biodiversity as one might expect for a sdtf woody species tended to show phylogenetic clustering whereas herbaceous species tended towards phylogenetic overdispersion we also found phylogenetic clustering in two edaphic environments sedimentary and crystalline in contrast to phylogenetic overdispersion in the third inselberg we conclude that while niche conservatism is evident in phylogenetic clustering in the caatinga this is not a universal pattern likely due to heterogeneity in the degree of realized environmental filtering across edaphic environments thus sdtf in spite of a strong shared environmental filter are potentially heterogeneous in phylogenetic structuring our results support the need for scientifically informed conservation strategies in the caatinga and other sdtf regions that have not previously been

long distance gene flow selection and drift occurred but differences due to spatial effects were three times as strong as differences attributed to temporal effects and suggested recollection efforts

sample along random transects with sufficient space between plants to minimize intrafamilial sampling quantifying genetic change between ex situ and in situ accessions allows genetic resource managers

species significant population differences in susceptibility were detected in threatened rare and endemic eucalypt species as well as australias main plantation eucalypt eucalyptus globulus and the worlds tallest angiosperm species eucalyptus regnans a significant proportion of the variation in host species susceptibility to this exotic pathogen was explained by phylogenetic history while factors such as habitat endemism and range size had no detectable effect species from subgenus eucalyptus 13 species were more susceptible than those from subgenus symphyomyrtus 17 species due to differences between the subgenera in the proportion of plants showing a symptomless response these subgenera are here shown to differ in their leaf oil and wax chemistry the potential contribution of these differences and other possible mechanisms causing these subgeneric differences in susceptibility are discussed this study demonstrates the power of a phylogenetic approach to risk assessment for

the aim of this study was to use microsatellite markers ssr for the characterization of the passiflora species and to verify the effect of random selection of individuals in parameters that characterize the genetic variability of germplasm for conservation purposes four species passiflora edulis f flavicarpa degener p cincinnata mast p alata curtis and p setacea dc were evaluated for each species two random samples were evaluated one consisting of 60 plants s60 and the other of 10 plants s10 randomly selected from the s60 initially the s10 and s60 were used to calculate the genetic parameters of number of alleles expected and observed heterozygosity effective population size inbreeding and polymorphic information content based on 40 microsatellite markers developed for p edulis and 20 for p alata further bootstrap analysis was performed to identify the minimum number of individuals needed to represent the variability of each passiflora species from a range of 2 to 59 the number of polymorphic microsatellites was 15 9 6 and 2 on p edulis f flavicarpa p cincinnata p alata and p setacea respectively the allelic loss due to the underrepresentation of the samples was 19 30 16 43 and nine 39 alleles respectively for p edulis f flavicarpa p cincinnata and p alata no allelic loss was observed for p setacea probably because only two polymorphic microsatellites were identified in general there are differences between s10 and s60 because of lost genetic variability on s10 indicating that the use of these 10 individuals to represent the passiflora species is insufficient for longterm preservation in contrast the bootstrap analysis revealed that the stability of the genetic parameters due to the increase in sample size was close to 30 23 25 and 24 individuals for p cincinnata p edulis f flavicarpa p setacea and p alata respectively the difference of genetic estimates between samples s10 and s60 demonstrated that 23–30 individuals are the minimum range of population to represent the passiflora species studied this study may optimize the strategies for conservation the passiflora germplasm avoiding the underrepresentation of samples and

higher clonal diversity than that reported in northern populations and no genotype was detected in more than one stand most clones exhibited aggregated distributions but some scattered clones were also found the clonal structures of the stands are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment is absent inside the stand a combined analysis of ages and genotypes revealed cycles of regrowth in which each clone experienced varying degrees of success in generating new ramets these degrees of success could be the consequence of varying abilities for vegetative propagation among genotypes

the shoot apical meristem in this study we characterized ft homologs in the temperate grasses brachypodium distachyon and polyploid wheat using transgenic and mutant approaches downregulation of ft1 by rnai was associated with a significant downregulation of the ftlike genes ft2 and ft4 in brachypodium and ft2 and ft5 in wheat in a transgenic wheat line carrying a highlyexpressed ft1 allele ft2 and ft3 were upregulated under both long and short days overexpression of ft1 caused extremely early flowering during shoot regeneration in both brachypodium and hexaploid wheat and resulted in insufficient vegetative tissue to support the production of viable seeds downregulation of ft1 transcripts by rna interference rnai resulted in nonflowering brachypodium plants and late flowering plants 24 weeks delay in wheat a similar delay in heading time was observed in tetraploid wheat plants carrying mutations for both fta1 and ftb1 plants homozygous only for mutations in ftb1 flowered later than plants homozygous only for mutations in fta1 which corresponded with higher transcript levels of ftb1 relative to fta1 in the early stages of development taken together our data indicate that ft1 plays a critical role in the regulation of flowering in brachypodium and wheat and that this role is associated with the simultaneous regulation of other ftlike genes the differential effects of mutations in fta1 and ftb1 on wheat heading time suggest that different allelic combinations of ft1 homoeologs could be used to adjust wheat heading time to improve adaptation to changing

relative low farming demands tuberbearing species are an important contribution to human dietary needs in many climatic zones and interest in these staple crops for processed food and other industrial uses is increasing over the past years we have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of the signalling mechanisms involved in the differentiation of these organs partly aided by their conservation with the wellcharacterized photoperiodic control of flowering in arabidopsis recent studies have led to the identification of members of the ft gene family as major component of the tuberinducing signal and the characterization of circadian and photoperiodic components involved in the regulation of these genes a relevant role of micrornas in the control of storage organ formation has been established and hormonal balance requirements similar to those controlling shoot branching were shown to be implicated in the activation of stolon meristem cells hence the recent finding that ft controls branching through direct interaction with the tcp factors holds great promise for the identification of genes acting as ft signal integrators in the stolon © 2014 elsevier ltd the origin of agriculture and the crop domestication are two of the most important processes in human history mexico is considered one of the main centers of origin of agriculture and domestication of plants intheworld evidence of domestication of several species of worldwide importance exists there for example thephaseolus beans lima bean p lunatus is one of the phaseolus species domesticated in mexico in this country it is a subsistence crop that is cultivated mainly by ethnic groups as part of their traditional agricultural systems such as the milpa alongside with lima bean landraces in mexico there are wild populations of this species regional studies have indicated the existence of high levels of genetic diversity within this crop and its wild populations and also have highlighted the importance of mexico for the conservation of this species recently molecular studies that have included new collections of wild lima bean throughoutmexico have confirmed the high levels of genetic diversity in this species and suggested the existence of threewild mesoamericangene pools also these studies suggest a scenario of multiple domestication events for smallseeded mesoamerican lima bean landraces in two putative domestication areas one of them in mexico in the nayaritjalisco or guerrerooaxacaareas and another one in a region between guatemala and costa rica although there have been significant recent advancesin our knowledge about the evolution of lima bean in mexico it is necessary to dig deeper into this important topic newcollections of wild and domesticated material in

intensity the grazing should be practiced on the qinghaitibetan plateau in china is always confusing farmers scientists and policy makers for a long time owing to its geographical exception in order to develop a strategy for sustainable grazing management we used the dominant stipa purpurea as a model species to detect genetic diversity and fine spatial structure under different grazing intensities intrapopulation neutral genetic diversity in nongrazed population was significantly higher than three grazed populations however the highest value among grazed populations appeared in the moderately grazed population a relatively low degree of genetic differentiation among populations by amova analysis and a high level of gene flow existed among populations gst  02649 nm  13875 〉 1 the genetic patch size increased from 4 m to 16 m and subpopulation number within the s purpurea populations ranged from 7 to 5 with increasing grazing intensity therefore grazing will be beneficial to reduce the fragmentation and to increase the populationlevel adaptation though enclosure or no grazing is the best protection of plant germplasm like windpollination s purpurea moderate grazing is

result in the formation of organs called nodules in which bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen to the benefit of the plant most of our knowledge on the metabolism and the physiology of the bacteria during symbiosis derives from studying roots nodules of terrestrial plants here we used a proteomics approach to investigate the bacterial physiology of photosynthetic bradyrhizobium sp ors278 during the symbiotic process with the semi aquatical plant aeschynomene indica that forms root and stem nodules we analyzed the proteomes of bacteria extracted from each type of nodule first we analyzed the bacteroid proteome at two different time points and found only minor variation between the bacterial proteomes of 2week and 3weekold nodules high conservation of the bacteroid proteome was also found when comparing stem nodules and root nodules among the stem nodule specific proteins were those related to the phototrophic ability of bradyrhizobium sp ors278 furthermore we compared our data with those obtained during an extensive genetic screen previously published the symbiotic role of four candidate genes which corresponding proteins were found massively produced in the nodules but not

primarily focused on endemics because of the assumption that in widespread taxa the absence of morphological differentiation between island and mainland populations is due to recent colonization in this paper we studied the phylogeography of scrophularia arguta a widespread annual species in an attempt to determine the number and spatiotemporal origins of dispersal events to canary islands four different regions its and ets from ndna and psbatrnh and psbjpeta from cpdna were used to date divergence events within s arguta lineages and determine the phylogenetic relationships among populations a haplotype network was obtained to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes our results support an ancient origin of s arguta miocene with expansion and genetic differentiation in the pliocene coinciding with the aridification of northern africa and the formation of the mediterranean climate indeed results indicate for canary islands three different events of colonization including two ancient events that probably happened in the pliocene and have originated the genetically most divergent populations into this species and interestingly a recent third event of colonization of gran canaria from mainland instead from the closest islands tenerife or fuerteventura in spite of the great genetic divergence among populations it has not implied any morphological

species of eucommiaceae using intersimple sequence repeat issr and sequencerelated amplified polymorphism srap markers we studied the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 187 accessions from 17 e ulmoides populations throughout its main distribution in china a total of 65 bands were amplified using eight issr primers of which 50 bands 769 were polymorphic meanwhile another 244 bands were observed using eight srap primer combinations and 163 668 of these were polymorphic the analysis of molecular variation amova indicated that 888 and 924 of the total variation resided within populations based on issr and srap analysis respectively moreover we found that the e ulmoides populations were clustered into six distinct groups using issr and srap markers via the unweighted pairgroup method upgma furthermore structure analysis showed that these 17 populations could be classified into four groups using issr markers but only two groups using srap markers nosignificant relevancy was observed between genetic and geographic distances among the sampled populations the results of this study support the view that exchange of seeds among local farmers plays an important role in shaping the present genetic distribution pattern “core collection” is suggested for genetic diversity conservation of e ulmoides in china ©funpecrp over the last 200 years genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred within and outside of species native distribution ranges for forestry and for research and development rd transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes ranging from the production of wood and nonwood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation the oldest form of rd provenance trials revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees international provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits but it is unlikely that molecular markerassisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods furthermore provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches currently seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources the situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees only limited tested or improved seed sources are available transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic makeup of already present tree populations many of these risks have been underestimated in the past but they are now better understood and managed relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants the implementation of the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing abs may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for rd purposes many countries are likely to struggle to establish a wellfunctioning abs regulatory system slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange this is unfortunate as climate change outbreaks of pests and diseases and continual pressure to support productivity increase the need for

was to assess patterns of genetic diversity and structure in 17 p ionantha populations and to determine if diversity is associated with geographic location or population characteristics we scored 240

ecosystem services approach to biodiversity conservation worry that volatile market conditions and technological substitutes will diminish the value of ecosystem services and obviate the economic benefits arguments for conservation to explore the effects of market forces and substitutes on service values we assessed how the value of the pestcontrol services provided by mexican freetailed bats tadarida brasiliensis mexicana to cotton production in the southwestern us has changed over time we calculated service values each year from 1990 through 2008 by estimating the value of avoided crop damage and the reduced social and private costs of insecticide use in the presence of bats over this period the ecosystem service value declined by 79 1909 million us dollars due to the introduction and widespread adoption of bt bacillus thuringiensis cotton transgenically modified to express its own pesticide falling global cotton prices and the reduction in the number of hectares in the us planted with cotton our results demonstrate that fluctuations in market conditions can cause temporal variation in ecosystem service values even when ecosystem function  in this case bat population numbers  is held constant evidence is accumulating however of the evolution of pest resistance to bt cotton suggesting that the value of bat pestcontrol services may increase again this gives rise to an economic option value argument for conserving mexican freetailed bat populations we anticipate that these results will spur discussion about the role of ecosystem services in biodiversity

biological studies have been performed for improving the sugar yield and other relevant important agronomic traits however due to sugarcanes complicated genomes it is still challenging to study the genetic basis of traits such as sucrose accumulation sucrose transporters suts are critical for both phloem loading in source tissue and sucrose uptaking in sink tissue and are considered to be the control points for regulating sucrose storage however no genomic study for sugarcane sucrose transporter sssut families has been reported up to date results by using comparative genomics and bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs six sut genes were identified and characterized in s spontaenum phylogenetic analyses revealed that the two pairs sssuts sssut1sssut3 and sssut5sssut6 could be clustered together into two separate monocot specific sut groups while sssut2 and sssut4 were separated into the other two groups with members from both dicot and monocot species gene structure comparison demonstrated that the number and position of exonsintrons in suts were highly conserved among the close orthologs in contrast there were variations among the paralogous suts in sacchuarm though with the high polyploidy level gene allelic haplotype comparative analysis showed that the examined four sssut members exhibited conservations of gene structures and amino acid sequences among the allelic haplotypes accompanied by variations of intron sizes gene expression analyses were performed for tissues from seedlings under drought stress and mature plants of three saccharum species sofficinarnum sspotaneum and srobustum both sut1 and sut4 expressed abundantly at different conditions sut2 had similar expression level in all of the examined tissues but sut3 was undetectable both of sut5 and sut6 had lower expression level than other gene member and expressed stronger in source leaves and are likely to play roles in phloem loading in the seeding plant leave under water stress four genes sut1 sut2 sut4 and sut5 were detectable in these detectable genes sut1 and sut4 were down regulated while sut2 and sut5 were up regulated conclusions in this study we presented the first comprehensive genomic study for a whole gene family the sut family in saccharum we speculated that there were six sut members in the s spotaneum genome out of the six members sssuts sssut5 and sssut6 were recent duplication genes accompanied by rapid evolution while sssut2 and sssut4 were the ancient members in the families despite the high polypoidy genome functional redundancy may not exist among the suts allelic haplotypes supported by the evidence of strong purifying selection of the gene allele sut3 could be a low active member in the family because it is undetectable in our study but it might not be a pseudogene because it harbored integrated gene structure sut1 and sut4 were the main members for the sucrose transporter while these suts had subfunctional divergence in response to sucrose

ire1bzip60 mrna and the other by site1site2 proteases s1ps2pbzip17bzip28 as the major sensor of upr in eukaryotes ire1 in response to endoplasmic reticulum er stress catalyzes the unconventional splicing of hac1 in yeast bzip60 in plants and xbp1 in metazoans recent studies suggest that ire1p and hac1 mrna the only upr pathway found in yeast evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust upr induction however the functional connectivity of ire1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of ire1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established here we report that ire1 and its substrate bzip60 function as a strictly cognate enzymesubstrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants moreover we show that the s1ps2pbzip17bzip28 pathway the other known branch of upr in plants does not play a detectable role in virus infection demonstrating the distinct function of the ire1bzip60 pathway in plants furthermore we provide evidence that bzip60 and hac1 products of the enzymesubstrate duet rather than ire1 are functionally replaceable to cope with er stress in yeast taken together we conclude that the downstream signaling of the ire1mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants and that the ire1bzip60 upr pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other upr branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virusplant interactions © 2015 zhang et al prokaryotes and eukaryotes respond to various

of available farmland and labor shortages were major reasons cited for crop abandonment despite an overall reduction in tartary buckwheat planting across a wide spectrum of farms we also found the

species of all plants occurring in small and scattered populations the species is currently classified as near threatened by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn and as vulnerable in three prefectures of japan this study investigated two major factors that should impact the genetic structure of the species at both the nuclear and organelle dna level the mating system and the inheritance of both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes the mating system is crucial to determining the degree of outcrossing of plant species and thus should have a key role in shaping the species population level genetic diversity and gene flow between populations but as yet has not been studied in s verticillata nine mother trees and their seedling progeny from two

implemented in the software mltr the study found an outcrossing rate in the seedling stage of 049 and 079 for aburazaka and mount shirotori populations respectively and an average of 066 at the species level these outcrossing rates were low for conifers and therefore may have potential deleterious implications for the conservation of the species the test of organelle inheritance supported

order hypocreales peptaibiotics are a group of secondary metabolites almost exclusively described from trichoderma species of hypocreaceae peptaibiotics are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrpss and have antibiotic and antifungal activities tolypocladium species are mainly truffle parasites but a few species are insect pathogens results the draft genome sequence of the truffle parasite tolypocladium ophioglossoides was generated and numerous secondary metabolite clusters were discovered many of which have no known putative product however three large peptaibiotic gene clusters were identified using phylogenetic analyses peptaibiotic genes are absent from the predominantly plant and insect pathogenic lineages of hypocreales and are therefore exclusive to the largely mycoparasitic lineages using nrps adenylation domain phylogenies and reconciliation of the domain tree with the organismal phylogeny it is demonstrated that the distribution of these domains is likely not the product of horizontal gene transfer between mycoparasitic lineages but represents independent losses in insect pathogenic lineages peptaibiotic genes are less conserved between species of tolypocladium and are the product of complex patterns of lineage sorting and module duplication in contrast these genes are more conserved within the genus trichoderma and consistent with diversification through speciation conclusions peptaibiotic nrps genes are restricted to mycoparasitic lineages of hypocreales based on current sampling phylogenomics and comparative genomics can provide insights into the evolution of secondary metabolite genes their distribution across a broader range of taxa and their possible function related to host specificity © 2015 quandt et al the

population the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world in cotton many major producing countries have adopted herbicidetolerant genetically modified crops overreliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicideresistant weeds poor weed management can cause up to 90 yield loss in cotton undoubtedly integration of nonchemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options including herbicides increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems choosing cultivars with early vigour use of narrow row planting orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds in addition herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds however the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cottongrowing countries and the success may depend on the environment soil type and resource availability this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much

these populations with those of neighboring native teak forests the genetic diversity and composition of one exotic plantation using costa rican seeds was similar to those of native populations however the diversity of the other three exotic plantations was low and their composition was markedly different from those of native populations our results suggest that exotic gene flow would cause serious genetic disturbance commercial plantations using myanmar seeds were characterized by relatively high genetic diversity and by many genetic components these results suggest that these

populations within locations in contrast there was no detected variation in the chloroplast genome the high genetic differentiation is consistent with limited contemporary connectivity among the geographically separated locations although lack of chloroplast haplotype variation indicates that limited connectivity has occurred more recently and is not due to historical isolation the level of differentiation suggests use of local seed sources for augmentation or establishment of populations within gene flow distance of existing populations whereas an experimental translocation established

exclusive alleles in order to avoid homoplasy here we propose a method for identification of species based on the amplification profile of groups of ssr markers obtained by a transferability study the approach considers that the ssr are conserved among related species in this context using psidium as a model 141 ssr markers developed for psidium guajava were transferred to 13 indigenous species of

few decades the current exchange model dictates that associated data is manually entered into each database the amount of time involved and the human errors occurring in this process are difficult to justify when the data was initially produced as a report from another database the authors propose that an online marketplace for seed exchange should be established with enhanced search possibilities and downloadable accession data in a standardised format such online service should preferably be supervised and coordinated by botanic gardens conservation international bgci this manuscript is the outcome of a workshop on july 9th 2015 at the european botanic gardens congress “eurogard vii” in paris where the first two authors invited members of the botanic garden community to discuss how the

ensure protein and lipid distribution in eukaryotic cells the current knowledge on the molecular components and mechanisms of this process is majorly based on studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana which revealed 240 different proteinaceous factors either experimentally proven or predicted to be involved in vesicle transport in here we performed an orthologue search using two different algorithms to identify the components of the secretory pathway in yeast and 14 plant genomes by using the coreset of 240 factors as bait we identified 4021 orthologues and coorthologues in the discussed plant species accounting for components of copii copi clathrin coated vesicles retromers and escrts rab gtpases tethering factors and snares in plants we observed a significantly higher number of coorthologues than yeast while only 8 tethering factors from yeast seem to be absent in the analyzed plant genomes to link the identified coorthologues to vesicle transport the domain architecture of the proteins from yeast genetic model plant a thaliana and agriculturally relevant crop solanum lycopersicum has been inspected for the orthologous groups containing coorthologues from yeast a thaliana and s lycopersicum we observed the same domain architecture for 79 416527 of the coorthologues which documents a very high conservation of this process further publically available tissuespecific expression profiles for a subset of coorthologues found in a thaliana and s lycopersicum suggest that some coorthologues are involved in tissuespecific functions inspection of localization of the coorthologues based on available proteome data or localization predictions lead to the assignment of plastid as well as mitochondrial localized coorthologues of vesicle transport

algalplant chloroplasts cyanobacteria are unusual in having two distinct clps paralogs although clpsl is typical of bacterial clps clps2 differs in crucial ways clps2 in synechococcus elongatus is a relatively lowabundant soluble protein essential for phototrophic growth like clpsl clps2 binds to the clpcp3r protease to block αcasein degradation and promote that of nend rule substrates in vitro however their substrate specificity differs with clpsl recognizing destabilizing phe and tyr residues at the substrate nterminus whereas clps2 recognizes leu overall clps2 appears to have

commercial mango cultivars in india are the result of selection from the natural seedling population and majority of them have been selected by the farmersthe conventional breeding system with traditional knowledge is evolving more and more towards preservation of genetic diversity in pusa site of the unepgef sponsored project in the bihar state of india many mango seedlings are found growing in the orchards as well as in the backyards mango being a highly crosspollinated fruit crop exhibits a lot of variability in morphophysicochemical traits of fruits in these seedling plants for selection of the elite seedling genotypes farmers play an important role and with the help of the breeder they can pave the way for maintaining the local germplasm hence in order to study the genetic variability among mango seedlings and to select elite mango genotypes and to conserve them a survey was conducted in the four project communities and the surrounding villages a total of 74 seedling types of mango were characterized using morphotaxonomic parameters physicochemical characterization of fruit samples revealed the existence of a great variability in the seedling mango plants which not only contributes to biological diversity but can also be used for crop improvement or for varietal selection based on this physicochemical characterization principal component and cluster analysis and grouping of seedling clones on the basis of possession of desirable characters by them six seedling clones having the majority of desirable fruit characteristics were selected these selected clones will definitely broaden the genetic base of mango in the pusa site as well offer the scope for choice of selection of varieties by the farmers and ultimately the conservation of the valuable

longterm studies of potential harm by favoured species on other sensitive species though seldom adopted are required to fairly evaluate the suitability of management and restoration efforts we illustrate the potential detrimental outcomes of conservation biased towards birds by investigating the longterm 19632009 impact of a large waterbird colony up to 13000 pairs on a remnant cork oak quercus suber population at a world biosphere reserve in southwestern spain the doñana national park to this end we compared changes in performance growth crown vigour and survival of oaks occupied and unoccupied by the waterbird colony after 46 years of occupation the risk of death to centenarian oaks in the area occupied by the colony was over twofold higher than for trees outside the area noncentenarian planted and naturally regenerated oaks showed similar trends leading to restoration failure synthesis and applications our longterm study reveals that waterbirds and centenarian oaks cannot coexist at the most local scale but they can at a regional scale including within the doñana area we propose immediate planting efforts in suitable colonyfree areas while managers evaluate the feasibility of relocating colonial waterbirds to an alternative location to preserve the doñana oak genetic pool such reforestation should be accomplished using local seeds and seedlings new trees should not be planted in close proximity of colonyoccupied trees since it significantly reduces their survival doñana stakeholders should both overcome current conservation bias in favour of birds and

from atp to transport copper across different biological membranes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells as they belong to the patpase family cuatpases contain a characteristic catalytic domain with an evolutionarily conserved aspartate residue phosphorylated by atp to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate as well as transmembrane helices containing a cationbinding cysteineprolinecysteinehistidineserine cpx motif for catalytic activation and cation translocation in addition most cuatpases possess the nterminal cubinding cxxc motif required for regulation of enzyme activity in cells the cuatpases receive copper from soluble chaperones and maintain intracellular copper homeostasis by efflux of copper from the cell or transport of the metal into the intracellular compartments in addition copper pumps play an essential role in cuproprotein biosynthesis by the uptake of copper into the cell or delivery of the metal into the chloroplasts and thylakoid lumen or into the lumen of the secretory pathway where the metal ion is incorporated into copperdependent enzymes in the recent years significant progress has been made toward understanding the function and regulation of cutransporting atpases in archaea bacteria yeast humans and plants providing new insights into the specific physiological roles of these essential proteins in various organisms and revealing some conservative

on a genome was determined in two durum wheat triticum turgidum ssp durum cvs ciccio and svevo characterized by different grain protein content genomic differences allowed the gene mapping in the centromeric region of chromosome 2a qtl analysis was conducted in the svevo6ciccio ril mapping population previously evaluated in 5 different environments the study colocalized the fdgogata gene with the marker gwm339 identifying a significant major qtl for gpc conclusions the wheat fdgogat genes are highly conserved both among the three homoeologous hexaploid wheat genes and in comparison with other plants in durum wheat an association was shown between the fdgogat allele of cv svevo with increasing gpc  potentially useful in breeding programs © 2014 nigro et al the continuous decline in earths biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline the challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity  especially since the majority of species on earth are undescribed by science all conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals however traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise nonstandardized sampling and the invasive nature of some survey techniques hence there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for largescale biodiversity monitoring environmental dna edna  defined here as genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples soil sediment water etc without any obvious signs of biological source material  is an efficient noninvasive and easytostandardize sampling approach coupled with sensitive costefficient and everadvancing dna sequencing technology it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring environmental dna has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems the research on edna initiated in microbiology recognizing that culturebased methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature subsequently as a method to assess the diversity of macroorganismal communities edna was first analyzed in sediments revealing dna from extinct and extant animals and plants but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples results from edna approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the future we expect the ednabased approaches to move from singlemarker analyses of species or communities to metagenomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns such advances have applications for a range of biological geological and environmental sciences here we review the achievements gained through analyses of edna from macroorganisms in a conservation context and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring © 2015 the authors the perennial trees in

to habitat modifications conservation strategies can be improved through the use of ecological niche models and genetic data to classify areas of high environmental suitability in this study we applied a maxent model integrated with genetic information nucleotide diversity haplotype diversity and fus fs neutrality tests to evaluate potential genetic pool populations with highly suitable areas for two parapatric endangered species of tucotucos ctenomys minutus and c lami our results demonstrated that both species were largely influenced by vegetation and soil variables at a landscape scale and inhabit a highly specific niche ctenomys minutus was also influenced by the variable altitude the species was associated with low altitudes sea level our model of genetic data associated with environmental suitability indicate that the genetic pool data were associated with highly suitable areas for c minutus this pattern was not evident for c lami but this outcome could be a consequence of the restricted range of the species the preservation of species requires not only detailed knowledge of their natural history and genetic structure but also information on the availability of suitable areas where species can survive and such knowledge can aid significantly in conservation planning this finding reinforces the use of these two techniques for planning

both animals and land plants our approach relied on features shared by all known organisms excluding sequence conservation genome localization and pattern of basepairing with the target we predicted between 500 and 1500 mirnas candidates depending on the values of the energetic parameters used to filter the potential precursors using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays we confirmed the existence of 22 mirnas among 72 candidates tested and of 8 predicted precursors in addition we compared the expression of mirnas and their precursors in two life cycle states sporophyte gametophyte and under salt stress several mirna precursors argonaute and dicer messenger rnas were differentially expressed in these conditions finally we analyzed the gene organization and the target functions of the predicted candidates this showed that e siliculosus mirna genes are like plant mirna genes rarely clustered and like animal mirna genes often located in introns among the predicted targets several widely conserved functional domains are significantly overrepresented like kinesin nucleotidebindingapaf1 r proteins and ced4 nbarc and tetratricopeptide repeats the combination of

problem has recently received strong interest with two distinct strands of importance the first is that too much phosphorus p is entering into waste water creating a significant economic and ecological problem secondly while agricultural demand for phosphate fertilizer is increasing to maintain crop yields rock phosphate reserves are rapidly declining unravelling the mechanisms by which plants sense respond to and acquire phosphate can address both problems allowing the development of crop plants that are more efficient at acquiring and using limited amounts of phosphate while at the same time improving the potential of plants and other photosynthetic organisms for nutrient recapture and recycling from waste water in this review we attempt to synthesize these important but often disparate parts of the debate in a holistic fashion since solutions to such a complex problem require integrated and multidisciplinary approaches that address both p supply and demand rapid progress has been made recently in our understanding of local and systemic signalling mechanisms for phosphate and of expression and regulation of membrane proteins that take phosphate up from the environment

significantly simplified the experimental procedure and accurately and concurrently identified different prey dna corresponding to the targeted taxonomic groups with ≥60 of taxa of all diet components identified to genusspecies level the systematic application of internal controls and replication was a useful and simple way to evaluate the performance of our experimental procedure standardize the selection of sequence filtering parameters for each marker data and validate the accuracy of the results our general approach can be adapted to the analysis of dietary samples of various predator

genetic elements iss are proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium nostoc azollae 0708 living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant the water fern azolla revealed the presence of an eroding genome with a high number of insertion sequences iss together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes to investigate the role of iss in the reductive evolution of nostoc azollae 0708 and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes a bioinformatic investigation of the is identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was conducted to widen the scope the is contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing both freeliving and symbiotic bacteria results insertion sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location local hopping and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of is elements in general symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of is elements and pseudogenes than nonsymbiotic bacteria a total of 1108 distinct repeated sequences over 500 bp were identified in the 67 genomes investigated in the genome of nostoc azollae 0708 is elements were apparent at 970 locations 143 with 428 being fulllength morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of is elements irrespective of life style conclusions the apparent colocation of is elements and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier is transpositions into genes as transpositions tend to be local rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity between is elements and pseudogenes these findings suggest that iss facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the symbiotic cyanobacterium nostoc azollae 0708 and in other obligate prokaryotic symbionts © 2015 vigilstenman et al licensee biomed central aim the evolutionary history of narrow endemic species has received little attention compared with that of more widely distributed species small effective population sizes and longterm isolation of many narrow endemic species make research on their genetic makeup important for their future conservation in this study we investigated the genetic variation and historical distribution of an isolated plant the monospecific genus pseudomisopates as an example of the phylogeographical history of narrow endemics location central range iberian peninsula mediterranean europe methods we used amplified fragment length polymorphisms aflps nuclear and plastid dna sequences and species distribution modelling sequence data were analysed using statistical parsimony molecular dating and a coalescentbased bayesian model of isolation with migration genetic diversity and differentiation analyses based on aflp data were performed we compared the detection of clones using aflps with the results of a previous study that used simple sequence repeats ssrs results aflp analysis revealed that ssrs underestimate clone number the coalescentbased bayesian model of isolation with migration suggested a late pleistocene divergence between the populations of pseudomisopates on two mountain massifs gredos and la serrota despite the presence of a large area suitable for population admixture moderate to high levels of genetic diversity and high effective population sizes were inferred main conclusions our results imply that the levels of genetic diversity within narrow endemic species from mediterranean mountains could primarily be driven by extrinsic historical factors rather than by intrinsic speciesspecific factors depending on their own biological characteristics narrow endemics are widely believed to harbour low genetic diversity because of small effective population sizes however this study and others on narrow endemic angiosperms demonstrate that narrow endemism

overall viability of tropical trees the response of tropical trees to fragmentation processes may however be species cohort or regionspecific here we test the hypothesis that forest fragmentation is associated with lower genetic variability and higher genetic differentiation in adult and seedling populations of prunus africana in northwestern ethiopia this is a floristically impoverished region where all but a few remnant forest patches have been destroyed mostly by anthropogenic meansresults genetic diversity based on allelic richness was significantly greater in large and lessisolated forest patches as well as in adults than seedlings nearly all pairwise fst comparisons showed evidence for significant population genetic differentiation mean fst values were significantly greater in seedlings than adults even after correction for within population diversity but varied little with patch size or isolationconclusions analysis of longlived adult trees suggests the formerly contiguous forest in northwestern ethiopia probably exhibited strong spatial patterns of genetic structure this means that protecting a range of patches including small and isolated ones is needed to conserve

broad range of plant hosts and humans by analysing the pangenome of eight sequenced p ananatis strains isolated from different sources we identified factors potentially underlying its ability to colonize and interact with hosts in both the plant and animal kingdomsresults the pangenome of the eight compared p ananatis strains consisted of a core genome comprised of 3876 protein coding sequences cdss and a sizeable accessory genome consisting of 1690 cdss we estimate that 106 unique cdss would be added to the pangenome with each additional p ananatis genome sequenced in the future the accessory fraction is derived mainly from integrated prophages and codes mostly for proteins of unknown function comparison of the translated cdss on the p ananatis pangenome with the proteins encoded on all sequenced bacterial genomes currently available revealed that p ananatis carries a number of cdss with orthologs restricted to bacteria associated with distinct hosts namely plant

genetic breeding and ex situ conservation of certain species such as brazilian pine faces several technical challenges including the difficulty of inducing embryogenic cultures using tissues of mature trees the loss of embryogenic competence of cell cultures and incomplete development of somatic embryos in order to understand the genetic factors governing embryogenesis a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to elucidate differences between distinct cell cultures early zygotic and somatic embryos and unorthodox seed developmental stages a total of 64 gb of sequence derived from highthroughput illumina rnaseq profiling was used for de novo transcriptome assembly the reference transcriptome resulted in 112772 predicted unigenes with an average length of 825 bp and an n50 of 1638 bp sequence similarity searches using a public protein database revealed 19947 unigenes that could be annotated with gene descriptions and gene ontology terms analysis of differential gene expression allowed pinpointing of genes whose products are predicted to be involved in cell line embryogenic potential early somatic embryo formation and unorthodox seed development the results expand our understanding of the complex molecular events that control embryogenesis suggesting that the regeneration impairment of araucaria angustifolia cultures is consequence of the auxin signaling failure the generated data lay the foundation for future functional genomic and evolutionary studies that will advance the understanding of conifer biology and unorthodox seed physiology © 2014 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht background despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of wild capsicum annuum l few investigations have been carried out to study basic characteristics the peninsula of baja california has a unique characteristic that it provides a high degree of isolation for the development of unique highly diverse endemic populations the objective of this study was to evaluate for the first time the growth type associated vegetation morphometric traits in plants in fruits and mineral content of roots stems and leaves of three wild populations of capsicum in baja california mexico near biosphere reserves results the results showed that the majority of plants of wild capsicum annuum have a shrub growth type and were associated with communities consisting of 43 species of 20 families the most representative being fabaceae cactaceae and euphorbiaceae significant differences between populations were found in plant height main stem diameter beginning of canopy leaf area leaf average and maximum width stems and roots dry weights coverage leaf length and dry weight did not show differences potassium sodium and zinc showed significant differences between populations in their roots stems and leaves while magnesium and manganese showed significant differences only in roots and stems iron in stems and leaves calcium in roots and leaves and phosphorus did not show differences average fruit weight length 100 fruits dry weight 100 fruits pulp dry weight and pulpseeds ratio showed significant differences between populations while fruit number average fruit fresh weight peduncle length fruit width seeds per fruit and seed dry weight did not show differences conclusions we concluded that this study of traits of wild capsicum provides useful information of morphometric variation between wild populations that will be of value for future decision processes involved in the management and preservation of

compared this with the previously reported common buckwheat f esculentum ssp ancestrale cp genome the cp genome of f tataricum has a total sequence length of 159272 bp which is 327 bp shorter than the common buckwheat cp genome the cp gene content order and orientation are similar to those of common buckwheat but with some structural variation at tandem and palindromic repeat frequencies and junction areas a total of seven indels around 100 bp were found within the intergenic sequences and the ycf1 gene copy number variation of the 21bp tandem repeat varied in f tataricum four repeats and f esculentum one repeat and the indel of the ycf1 gene was 63 bp long nucleotide and amino acid have highly conserved coding sequence with about 98 homology and four genes  rpoc2 ycf3 accd and clpp  have high synonymous ks value pcr based indel markers were applied to diverse genetic resources of f tataricum and f esculentum and the amplicon size was identical to that expected in silico therefore

the characteristic of climatic change is increase in the frequency of extreme events that are likely to decrease crop yield the geographic areas that are currently most foodinsecure are likely to be most affected by changing climates climate change is likely to affect all dimensions of crop production agricultural crop production depends upon the timely availability of goodquality seeds in adequate quantity at affordable prices to the farming communities genetic diversity and breeding for improved stresstolerant genotypes are key elements in tackling climate change plant genetic resources pgrs are important sources for developing new and improved varieties the loss of these genetic resources due to climate change will deprive source of diversity and tolerance currently more emphasis has been placed for ex situ conservation while equally if not more urgency is required to conserve the pgrs in in situ at present a number of international agreements are enforced for germplasm exchange and utilization some of the important methods to develop and disseminate new cultivars include breeding new crop varieties for wider adaptation under adverse climatic conditions using both classical and modern approaches and seed production through participatory approaches participatory breeding programs have successfully led to the development and dissemination of varieties in cereals seed industry plays an important role in increasing productivity of crops the adverse effect of climate change on the seed industry can be minimized by developing efficient seed management systems breeding seed production seed certification and seed trade some efficient systems include adjustment of crop calendars for quality seed production management of pollinators strengthening hybrid seed production postharvest management of seed seed treatment technologies seed processing and seed storage for faster and timely development partnerships public and private at various levels regional and international are crucial there is an urgent need to strengthen both formal and informal seed systems including characterization of environment to find suitable geographic regions for quality seed production for seed certification harmonization of various international seed certification schemesprograms and seed testing procedures are essential this will also help in efficient and safe movement of seed to influence seed trade the effective management of intellectual property rights sanitary and phytosanitary certificates in addition to management of trade barriers are all of prime importance for growth of the seed industry in both developed and developing nations public investments in plant breeding and seed industry are on the decline this trend needs to be reversed by emphasizing the need to increase research funding to all stakeholders of genetic resources and seed industry to develop strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural systems © 2015 elsevier inc the distinct distribution and abundance of ctou and utoc rna editing among land plants suggest that these two processes originated and evolve independently but the paucity of information from several key lineages limits our understanding of their evolution to examine the evolutionary diversity of rna editing among ferns we sequenced the plastid transcriptomes from two early diverging species ophioglossum californicum and psilotum nudum  using a relaxed automated approach to minimize false negatives combined with manual inspection to eliminate false positives we identified 297 ctou and three utoc edit sites in the o californicum plastid transcriptome but only 27 ctou and no utoc edit sites in the p nudum plastid transcriptome a broader comparison of editing content with the leptosporangiate fern adiantum capillusveneris and the hornwort anthoceros formosae uncovered large variance in the abundance of plastid editing indicating that the frequency and type of rna editing is highly labile in ferns edit sites that increase protein conservation among species are more abundant and more efficiently edited than silent and nonconservative sites suggesting that selection maintains functionally important editing the absence of utoc editing from p nudum plastid transcripts and other vascular plants demonstrates that utoc editing loss is a recurrent phenomenon

paleopolyploidy after the duplication of the ancient genome wholesale gene loss and gene subfunctionalization has occurred using the extensin supergene family as an example we tracked the differential retention and expansion of ancestral extensin genes in four modern rosids arabidopsis populus vitis and carica using several analytical methodsresults the majority of extensin genes in each of the modern rosids were found to originate from different ancestral genes in arabidopsis and populus almost half of the extensins were paralogous duplicates within the genome of each species by contrast no paralogous extensins were detected in vitis and carica which have only undergone the common γtriplication event it was noteworthy that a group of extensins containing the ipr006706 domain had actively duplicated in arabidopsis giving rise to a neoextensin around every 3 million years however such extensins were absent from or rare in the other three rosids a detailed examination revealed that this group of extensins had proliferated significantly in the genomes of a number of species in the brassicaceae we propose that this group of extensins might play important roles in the biology and in the evolution of the brassicaceae our analyses also revealed that nearly all of the paralogous and orthologous extensinpairs have been under strong purifying selection leading to the strong conservation of the function of extensins duplicated from the same ancestral geneconclusions our analyses show that extensins originating from a common ancestor have been differentially retained and expanded among four modern rosids our findings suggest that if arabidopsis is used as the model plant we can only learn a limited amount about the functions of a particular gene family these results also provide an example of how it is essential to learn the origination of a gene when analyzing its function across different plant species © 2014 guo et al spatial genetic structure sgs in plants is primarily determined by the interaction between pollen and seed dispersal but it is strongly affected by both evolutionary and ecological processes sgs studies in forest species also allow evaluating the consequences of humanmediated disturbance on pollen and seed movement and designing strategies of sustainable use of native forest resources the present paper compares finescale sgs between two populations of prosopis alba fernandezforres ff and campo duran cd based on the variation of 12 ssr markers populations show different history management and levels of disturbance ff is highly disturbed and fragmented by agricultural activity and stockbreeding although no significant differences were observed in genetic variability parameters highly significant genetic differentiation was detected with virtually no admixture between populations sgs was positive and significant at short distances only in the nondisturbed population of cd accordingly estimated neighborhood size and effective gene dispersal are higher in ff than in cd this result might be explained by the higher incidence of livestock in seed dispersal and the patchy structure favoring longer pollen movement and artificial thinning and selection in ff the results are relevant to conservation and breeding programs suggesting that the distance between seed trees to be sampled should be larger than 22 m the

functional conservation and divergence of duplicated genes will strengthen our understanding of their evolutionary course here we conducted a systemic functional investigation of phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins pebps in soybean glycine max and arabidopsis thaliana our results demonstrated that after the ancestral duplication the lineage of the common ancestor of the flowering locus t ft and terminal flower1 tfl1 subfamilies functionally diverged fromthe mother of ft and tfl1 mft subfamily to activate flowering and repress flowering respectively they also underwent further specialization after subsequent duplications although the functional divergence increased with duplication age we observed rapid functional divergence for a few pairs of young duplicates in soybean association analysis between amino acids and functional variations identified critical amino acid residues that led to functional differences in pebp members using transgenic analysis we validated a subset of these differences we report clear experimental evidence for the functional evolution of the pebps in the mft ft and tfl1 subfamilies which predate the origin of angiosperms our results highlight the role of amino acid divergence in driving evolutionary novelty after duplication © 2015 american society of plant biologists all rights reserved competition between individuals belonging to the same species is a universal feature of natural populations and is the process underpinning organismal adaptation despite its importance still comparatively little is known about the genetic variation responsible for competitive traits here we measured the phenotypic variation and quantitative genetics parameters for two fitnessrelated traits—eggtoadult viability and development time—across a panel of drosophila strains under varying larval densities both traits exhibited substantial genetic variation at all larval densities as well as significant genotypebyenvironment interactions geis gei was attributable to changes in the rank order of reaction norms for both traits and additionally to differences in the betweenline variance for development time the coefficient of genetic variation increased under stress conditions for development time while it was higher at both high and low densities for viability while development time also correlated negatively with fitness at high larval densities—meaning that fast developers have high fitness—there was no correlation with fitness at low density this result suggests that gei may be a common feature of fitnessrelated genetic variation and further that trait values under noncompetitive conditions could be poor indicators of individual fitness the latter point could have significant implications for animal and plant breeding programs as well as for conservation genetics © 2016 the authors ecology and evolution published by john wiley  sons ltd genetic diversity is a crucial

expanded in both pepper and nicotiana benthamiana nonsynonymous vs synonymous kaks substitution ratio revealed that most of the solanaceous dmtase homologs undergo purifying selection the genomic sequences of tomato dmt homologs in its wild relative solanum pennellii remained highly conserved in their exons and methyltransferase domains structure analysis further revealed highly similar folding of dmtase homologs and conservation in the residues participating in proteinprotein interaction in solanum lineage whereas a considerable diversification was observed of pepper homologs transcript profiling of dmtases highlighted both similar and distinct expression patterns of tomato homologs in other species during fruit development and stress responses overall our analysis

occurs in highdensity stands across a fragmented landscape spanning a contrasting elevation and precipitation gradient we examined genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure in this geographically isolated and genetically distinct population we characterized population genetic diversity at 11 nuclear microsatellite loci in 260 individuals from 13 sites we monitored flowering time at 10 sites and characterized the local environment in order to compare observed spatial genetic structure to hypotheses of isolationbydistance and isolationbyenvironment finally we quantified pollen dispersal distances and tested for local adaptation through a reciprocal transplant experiment in order to experimentally address these hypotheses results high genetic diversity ismaintained in the population and the genetic variation is significantly structured among sampled sites we identified 5 distinct genetic clusters and average pollen dispersal predominately occurred over short distances differences among sites in flowering phenology and environmental factors however were not strictly associated with genetic differentiation growth and survival of upland and lowland progeny in their native and foreign environments was expected to exhibit evidence of local adaptation due to the more extreme dry season in the lowlands seedlings planted in the lowland garden experiencedmuch higher mortality than seedlings in the upland garden but we did not identify evidence for local adaptation conclusion overall this study indicates that the costa rican q oleoides population has a rich

background over the last decade genetic markerbased plant breeding strategies have gained increasing attention because genotyping technologies are no longer limiting now the challenge is to optimally use genetic markers in practical breeding schemes for simple traits such as some disease resistances it is possible to target a fixed multilocus allele configuration at a small number of causal or linked loci efficiently obtaining this genetic ideotype from a given set of parental genotypes is known as the markerassisted gene pyramiding problem previous methods either imposed strong restrictions or used black box integer programming solutions while this paper explores the power of an explicit heuristic approach that exploits the underlying genetic structure to prune the search space results gene stacker is introduced as a novel approach to markerassisted gene pyramiding combining an explicit directed acyclic graph model with a pruned generation algorithm inspired by a simple exhaustive search both exact and heuristic pruning criteria are applied to reduce the number of generated schedules it is shown that this approach can effectively be used to obtain good solutions for stacking problems of varying complexity for more complex problems the heuristics allow to obtain valuable approximations for smaller problems fewer heuristics can be applied resulting in an interesting qualityruntime tradeoff gene stacker is competitive with previous methods and often finds better andor additional solutions within reasonable time because of the powerful heuristics conclusions the proposed approach was confirmed to be feasible in combination with heuristics to cope with realistic complex stacking problems the inherent flexibility of this approach allows to easily address important breeding constraints so that the obtained schedules can be widely used in practice without major modifications in addition the ideas applied for gene stacker can be incorporated in and extended for a plant breeding context that eg also addresses complex quantitative traits or conservation of genetic background gene stacker is freely available as open source

biogeographical history and speciation of plants to disentangle the present phylogeographical patterns and evolutionary history of two closely related parapatric species from ephedra ephedra sinica and e intermedia we systematically profiled their population genetic structures niche divergence and potential speciation processes based on sequence variation of four chloroplast dna fragments and climatebased ecological niche modelling enm phylogenetic analyses suggested that e sinica formed a monophyly which was nested in e intermedia the latter species formed two paraphyletic subclades corresponding to western and eastern lineages furthermore the phylogeographical analysis results indicated very significant inter and intraspecies genetic differentiation and beast inference suggested that e sinica diverged from e intermedia at 320 million years ago ma 95  hpd 205–810 ma while the western lineage of e intermedia diverged much earlier at 610 ma 95  hpd 410–1182 ma in addition niche identity tests performed using maxent strongly supported the hypothesis that the two sister species had significantly diverged on their ecological niches isolation by geographical and environment distance ibd and ibe tests suggested that the overall divergence of the populations from the two species were more influenced by environmental factors our data provide new insight into the ecological

conservation challenges in plants that attract pollinators with pollinatorspecific chemical signals geographical variation in pollinator species may indicate the presence of cryptic plant taxa we investigated this phenomenon in the rare sexually deceptive orchid drakaea elastica using a molecular phylogenetic analysis to resolve pollinator species boundaries pollinator choice experiments and a population genetic study of the orchid pollinator choice experiments demonstrated the existence of two ecotypes within delastica each attracting their own related but phylogenetically distinct pollinator species despite the presence of ecotypes population genetic differentiation was low across populations at six microsatellite loci fst0026 however bayesian structure analysis revealed two genetic clusters broadly congruent with the ecotype distributions these ecotypes may represent adaptation to regional variation in pollinator availability and perhaps the early stages of speciation with pronounced morphological and genetic differences yet to evolve resolution of the taxonomic status of the delastica ecotypes is required as this has implications for conservation efforts and

endangered juniper species endemic to the canary islands juniper woodlands have been depleted since the arrival of human inhabitants confined extant populations to marginal lands more recently longdistance dispersers have been extirpated from the study area potentially eliminating connectivity among fragmented populations we expected strong intrapopulation subdivision and high levels of inbreeding and kinship that should negatively affect individual fitness we found evidence of population subdivision into several mating neighbourhoods k  13 some of them highly inbred however contrary to our expectations neither inbreeding nor mean kinship mediated a population response to environmental factors our results suggest three remedial actions to reverse the declining demographic trends i reestablish native vegetation to ameliorate local environmental conditions ii restore dispersal services to increase connectivity and iii monitor fitness decline to identify lagged effects associated

taxa to better understand the ecological associations between steppic beetles and their host plants we tested the hypothesis that leaf beetles and weevils differ in food selection as a result of their phylogenetic relations within genera and between families and interactions with host plants we found 224 links between the beetles and the plants beetles belonging to seven genera feed on the same or related plants their preferences were probably inherited from common ancestors andor resulted from the host plants chemistry beetles from four genera feed on different plants possibly reducing intrageneric competition and possibly due to an adaptation to different plant chemical defences we found significant correlations between the numbers of leaf beetle and weevil species feeding on particular plants for polyphagous taxa but not for nonpolyphagous beetles finally we found that the previous identifications of host plants based on direct observations are generally concordant with

maintaining the genetic viability of timber species is especially important to sustaining the productivity and quality of timber in tropical production forests because the diversity of tree species is high their population densities are low and pollen dispersal of many species is limited to short distances conservation of the genetic diversity of timber species also enhances the conservation value of production forests and contributes to landscape connectivity tropical forests are commonly managed under selection logging regimes with minimum diameter cutting limits these typically result in systematic removal of the largest and often the most fecund trees very little guidance is available to forest managers on the measures needed to maintain viable populations of timber species in production forests we reviewed current knowledge regarding the impacts of logging on genetic processes in tropical asian tree species to find foundations for developing practical guidelines for managing these impacts and to identify research needs the review focuses on mixed dipterocarp forests where the canopy layer is dominated by trees of the dipterocarpaceae family one of the most globally important timber families we examined the impacts of practices including logging intensity minimum diameter cutting limits and spatial patterns of tree removal with regards to biological parameters such as effective breeding units size at reproductive maturity finescale spatial genetic structure and the importance of general flowering in producing diverse seed research conducted to date shows that because of characteristics such as naturally low population densities limited pollen dispersal and finescale spatial genetic structure many tree species in mixed dipterocarp forests are sensitive to reductions in the density of reproductive conspecifics in most cases tree extraction resulted in increased inbreeding although genetic research in these forests is still limited enough knowledge exists to initiate the development of practical management guidelines eg on minimum population densities as a precondition for logging or documentation of sources of propagation material used in enrichment planting future research should focus on studying species characteristics which can indicate vulnerability to genetic erosion and the prevalence of these characteristics among species in mixed dipterocarp forests to identify species or species groups which may require specific measures to maintain genetically viable populations in logged forests and in the larger landscape such characteristics may include large size at reproductive maturity or slow increase in fecundity with size finescale spatial genetic structure low population densities limited pollen

sustainability of dry subtropical and tropical agricultural systems the use of crop wild relatives cwr in pigeonpea breeding has been successful in providing important resistance quality and breeding efficiency traits to the crop current breeding objectives for pigeonpea include increasing its tolerance to abiotic stresses including heat cold drought and waterlogging here we assess the potential for pigeonpea cwr to be further employed in crop improvement by compiling wild species occurrence and ex situ conservation information producing geographic distribution models for the species identifying gaps in the comprehensiveness of current germplasm collections and using ecogeographic information to identify cwr populations with the potential to contribute agronomic traits of priority to breeders the fifteen prioritized relatives of pigeonpea generally occur in south and southeast asia to australia with the highest concentrations of species in southern india and northern australia these taxa differ considerably among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature precipitation and edaphic conditions we find that these wild genetic resources are

• key results wild brinjal is a spiny lowgrowing perennial commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides wastelands and sparsely vegetated areas near villages and agricultural fields fourteen of the 23 wild populations in our study occurred within 05 km of cultivated brinjal and at least nine flowered in synchrony with the crop hand crosses between wild and cultivated brinjal resulted in seed set and viable f 1 progeny wild brinjal flowers that were bagged to exclude pollinators did not set fruit and fruit set from manual selfpollination was low the exserted stigmas of wild brinjal are likely to promote outcrossing the most effective pollinators appeared to be bees amegilla xylocopa nomia and heterotrigona spp which also were observed foraging for pollen on crop brinjal

tolerance three hundred saplings from five different open pollinated mothers five families were offered to deer in a feeding trial and saplings were left to recover from browsing for one and a half years two annual growth seasons in a randomised replicated common garden seven sapling traits were assessed at this time survival stem diameter below the leading bud stem diameter at the base of the sapling total sapling height length of the leading bud average length of three lateral buds and the total number of lateral buds results indicate that browsing of scots pine by deer influences sapling survival and recovery ability there were significant family differences in morphological growth traits and these differences were maintained in the presence and absence of browsing for one recovery trait length of the leading bud overcompensation in response to browsing was evident in all families these data matched with our finding of no negative relationships between any recovery traits indicate that scots pine is quite robust to onceoff browsing events by deer we suggest that at the sapling stage scots pine do not employ resistance as a strategy against deer but tolerate deer browsing to counteract the negative impacts of herbivory hence the use of recovery traits as a management tool to mitigate the negative impacts of browsing is an option worthy of further investigation

thought to play a role in virulence by helping pathogens survive stress we previously demonstrated that the xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola protein avrrxo1 is a type iiisecreted virulence factor that has structural similarities to the zeta family of ta toxins and is toxic to plants and bacteria in the absence of its predicted chaperone arc1 in this work we confirm that avrrxo1 and its binding partner arc1 function as a ta system when expressed in escherichia coli sequences of avrrxo1 homologs were culled from published and newly generated phytopathogen genomes revealing that avrrxo1arc1 modules are rare or frequently inactivated in some species and highly conserved in others cloning and functional analysis of avrrxo1 from acidovorax avenae a citrulli burkholderia andropogonis xanthomonas translucens and xanthomonas euvesicatoria showed that some avrrxo1 homologs share the bacteriostatic and rxo1mediated cell death triggering activities of avrrxo1 from x oryzae additional distant putative homologs of avrrxo1 and arc1 were identified in genomic or metagenomic sequence of environmental bacteria with no known pathogenic role one of these distant homologs was cloned from the filamentous soil bacterium cystobacter fuscus avrrxo1 from c fuscus caused watersoaking and triggered rxo1dependent cell collapse in nicotiana benthamiana but no growth suppression in e coli was observed this work confirms that a type iii effector can function as a ta system toxin and illustrates the potential of microbiome data to reveal new environmental origins or reservoirs of pathogen

this weed has a complex mode of infestation that adapts to many hosts and environments complicating conventional breeding for resistance which is the only form of crop improvement available to eritrean breeders but has failed this study aimed at improving resistance against this parasite by transferring 5 striga resistant quantitative trait loci qtls from resistance donor n13 to striga susceptible farmerpreferred sorghum variety fpsv hugurtay from eritrea the method involved backcrossing using markerassisted selection mas and evaluation of the best introgressed lines for striga resistance in artificially infested fields foreground selection was performed with up to 11 polymorphic simple sequence repeat ssr markers linked to striga resistance qtls while background selection was conducted in the bc3f2 generation with 27 polymorphic unlinked ssr markers to identify the best recovery of the recurrent parent rp genetic background out of 84 bc3f3 lines l2p3b l1p5a and l2p5p35 performed best with respect to both grain yield and reduced striga infestation these lines were more resistant to striga than hugurtay but less resistant than n13 the three lines yielded twice as much as n13 with area under striga number progression curve ausnpc values on average 18 higher than that of n13 and 38 lower than that of hugurtay this suggests that the introgressed qtls conferred significant striga resistance and yield advantage to these bc3f3 backcross progenies under striga pressure these lines have good potential for future release and demonstrate that when mas is available

biological control agent for fallopia japonica © 2016 published by nrc research press parthenocarpic fruit is a very attractive trait for consumers and especially in eggplants where seeds can lead to browning of the flesh and bitterness however the molecular mechanisms underlying parthenocarpy in eggplant still remain unknown some auxin response factors have been previously shown in model species such as arabidopsis and tomato to play an important role in such a process here we have identified a natural parthenocarpic mutant and showed that arf8 from eggplant smarf8 is downregulated in buds compared to wildtype plants further characterization of smarf8 showed that it is a nuclear protein and an active transcriptional regulator we determined that amino acids 629–773 of smarf8 act as the transcriptional activation domain the c terminus of smarf8 is the proteinbinding domain and that smarf8 might form homodimers expression analysis in eggplant showed that smarf8 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues and organs and is responsive to auxin eggplant transgenic lines harboring rna interference of smarf8 exhibited parthenocarpy in unfertilized flowers suggesting that smarf8 negatively regulates fruit initiation interestingly smarf8overexpressing arabidopsis lines also induced parthenocarpy these results indicate that smarf8 could affect the dimerization of auxinindole acetic acid repressors with smarf8 via domains iii and iv and thus induce fruit development furthermore the introduction of smarf8 fulllength cdna could partially complement the parthenocarpic phenotypes in arabidopsisarf81 and arf84 mutants collectively our results demonstrate that smarf8 may act as a key negative regulator involved in parthenocarpic fruit development of eggplant these findings give more insights into the conserved mechanisms leading to parthenocarpy in which auxin signaling plays a pivotal role and provide potential target for eggplant breeding © 2015

this rare picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area no more than 300 ha and has been subject of several studies involving different topics such as ecology genetic structure and climate change the overall aim of these studies was to obtain a dataset for developing management tools to help decision makers implement preservation and conservation strategies however this unique forest tree

pinus strobiformis pseudotsuga menziesii and populus tremuloides of the picea chihuahuana tree community at fourteen locations the hill numbers were used as a diversity measure the results revealed a significant correlation between tree species diversity and genetic structure in populus tremuloides because the relationship between the two levels of diversity was found to be positive for the putative adaptive aflp detected genetic and species structures of the tree community were possibly simultaneously adapted to a combination of ecological or environmental factors the present findings

homogeneous subgroup of the eukaryotic superfamily of lamotif lam containing factors members of the larp1 family are found in most protists fungi plants and animals we review here evidence suggesting that larp1 are key versatile messenger rna mrnabinding proteins involved in regulating important biological processes such as gametogenesis embryogenesis sex determination and cell division in animals as well as acclimation to stress in yeasts and plants larp1 proteins perform all these essential tasks likely by binding to key mrnas and regulating their stability andor translation in human the impact of larp1 over cell division and proliferation is potentially under the control of the torc1 complex we review data suggesting that larp1 is a direct target of this master signaling hub tordependent larp1 phosphorylation could specifically enhance the translation of top mrnas providing a way to promote translation growth and proliferation consequently larp1 is found to be significantly upregulated in many malignant cell types in plants larp1 was found to act as a cofactor of the heatinduced mrna degradation process an essential acclimation strategy leading to the degradation of more than 4500 mrnas coding for growth and development housekeeping functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae the larp1 proteins slf1p and sro9p are important among other things for copper

monoecious plants with unisexual flowers on the same individual here we isolate the sup ortholog in cucumis sativus l cssup a monoecious vegetable cssup is predominantly expressed in female specific organs the female flower buds and ovules ectopic expression of cssup in arabidopsis can partially complement the fruit development in sup5 mutant and its overexpression in widetype leads to reduced

many species assisted colonization or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential however species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes relocating multiple distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat  a strategy known as assisted gene flow to better inform these policies we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume chamaecrista fasciculata in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating we monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses to assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southernmost population warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass population performance was dependent on latitude of origin with the northernmost population performing best under ambient conditions and the southernmost performing most poorly even under elevated temperatures amongpopulation differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern and southernmost populations all plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive however photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for longterm persistence especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes with strategic planning our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation © 2015 john wiley  sons ltd a large fraction of any bacterial genome

nitrogen with either galega orientalis or g officinalis has made it a target in research on determinants of host specificity in nitrogen fixation the genomic differences between representative strains of the two symbiovars are however relatively small this introduced a need for a dataset representing a larger bacterial population in order to make better conclusions on characteristics typical for a subset of the species in this study we produced draft genomes of eight strains of n galegae having different symbiotic phenotypes both with regard to host specificity and nitrogen fixation efficiency these genomes were analysed together with the previously published complete genomes of n galegae strains hambi 540t and hambi 1141 results the results showed that the presence of an additional rpon sigma factor gene in the symbiosis gene region is a characteristic specific to symbiovar orientalis required for nitrogen fixation also the nifq gene was shown to be crucial for functional symbiosis in both symbiovars genomewide analyses identified additional genes characteristic of strains of the same symbiovar and of strains having similar plant growth promoting properties on galega orientalis many of these genes are involved in transcriptional regulation or in metabolic functions conclusions the results of this study confirm that the only symbiosisrelated gene that is present in one symbiovar of n galegae but not in the other is an rpon gene the specific function of this gene remains to be determined however new genes that were identified as specific for strains of one symbiovar may be involved in determining host specificity while others are defined as potential determinant genes for differences in efficiency of nitrogen fixation © Österman et al licensee biomed central

were also developed to characterize genetic variations between and within onion varieties previous studies examining west africa onion varieties showed that only six enzyme systems are polymorphic however only twentyfour isozymes have been used to compare the onion to other allium species this low number of polymorphic biochemical markers makes it more difficult to determine the genetic diversity of onions on the other hand molecular markers at dna level such as rapd rflp aflp ssr are very useful to analyze diversity at varietal and species level using cultivated and spontaneous

study examined the suitability of lowtemperature storage of dehydrated cassava secondary somatic embryos as an alternative shortterm conservation approach to recycling the study included two experiments in the first one somatic embryogenesis from cotyledons of dehydrated secondary somatic embryos stored at six temperatures for 4 8 and 12 months was established and in the second plant regeneration via shoot organogenesis using somatic cotyledon explants obtained in the first experiment was examined the growth photosynthetic pigment contents and genetic stability of the regenerated plants were assessed at each storage temperature the survival of explants somatic embryogenesis shoot induction and elongation decreased with increases in storage period at 4 months after storage mas explant survival frequency of somatic embryogenesis shoot induction elongation and rooting had the best responses at 16ec and 20ec similarly the growth and photosynthetic pigment contents of plants regenerated from somatic embryos preserved at 16 °c and 20 °c recorded the best results at 4 mas however at 8 and 12 mas the best explant survival somatic embryogenesis shoot induction and elongation were recorded at 16 °c eight rapd primers produced a total of 56 distinct and scorable bands ranging from 250 bp to 3000 bp in size an random amplified dna rapd analysis showed a uniform banding profile among regenerants and to that of the mother plant indicating no genetic variation among regenerants and between the regenerants and the mother plant the data presented here suggest that cassava secondary somatic embryos dehydrated to 50 moisture content should be preserved at 1620 °c for 4 months for 8 and 12 months storage the embryos should be stored at 16 °c no genetic alteration was detected among the regenerants therefore the method is a suitable means for shortterm conservation of cassava secondary somatic embryos © 2015 institute of bioorganic chemistry all rights reserved the very rare mexican picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area of no more than 300 ha in the sierra madre occidental this special tree community has been the subject of several studies aimed at learning more about the genetic structure and ecology of the species and the potential effects of climate change the spatial distribution of trees is a result of many ecological processes and can affect the degree of competition between neighbouring trees tree density variability in size and distribution regeneration survival growth mortality crown formation and the biological diversity within forest communities numerous scaledependent measures have been established in order to describe spatial forest structure the overall aim of most of these studies has been to obtain data to help design preservation and conservation strategies in this study we examined the spatial distribution pattern of trees in the p chihuahuana tree community in 12 localities in relation to i tree stand density ii diameter distribution vertical structure iii tree species diversity iv geographical latitude and v tree dominance at a fine scale in 025 ha plots with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the complex ecosystem processes and biological diversity because of the strongly mixed nature of this tree community which often produces low population densities of each tree species and random tree fall gaps caused by tree death we expect aggregated patterns in individual picea chihuahuana trees and in the p chihuahuana tree community repulsive picea patterns to other tree species and repulsive patterns of young to adult trees each location was represented by one plot of 50 x 50 m 025 ha established in the centre of the tree community the findings demonstrate that the hypothesis of aggregated tree pattern is not applicable to the mean pattern measured by clark evans index uniform angle index and mean directional index of the unevenaged p chihuahuana trees and p chihuahuana tree community and but to specific spatial scales measured by the univariate lfunction the spatial distribution pattern of p chihuahuana trees was found to be independent of patches of other tree species measured by the bivariate lfunction the spatial distribution was not significantly related to tree density diameter distribution or tree species diversity the index of clark and evans decreased significantly from the southern to northern plots containing all tree species selfthinning due to intra and interspecific competitioninduced mortality is probably the main cause of the decrease in aggregation intensity during the course of population development in this tree community we recommend the use of larger sampling plots  025 ha in unevenaged and speciesrich forest ecosystems to detect

sharing this diversity in conjunction with a regional virustested in vitro collection the adaptive potential of populations and therefore their ability to cope with rapid environmental changes is a question of paramount fundamental and applied importance however what is still not clear is the effect of population position within the species range ie core vs edge on population adaptive potential and whether the adaptive potential can be predicted from extent of neutral molecular variation in this study we compared the extent and structure of neutral ssr and presumably adaptive quantitative trait genetic variation in populations of triticum dicoccoides sampled at the species range core and two opposite edges and related this information to multigenerational performance of plants experimentally introduced beyond the range edge the plants from the species arid edge performed worse than plants from the more mesic core in extreme desert conditions the core and edge populations did not differ in extent of ssr variation in contrast to the neutral genetic variation there was lower quantitative trait variation in the two edge as compared with the core population for many traits and no trait in any edge population had higher variation than the core population or either of its habitats reduced variation in selectively important traits indicates a lower adaptive potential of the two edge as compared with the core population our results imply 1 that extent of variation in quantitative traits can predict plant performance in novel environments while extent of variation in molecular markers can not and 2 caution in usage of peripheral populations in such conservation actions as relocation and creation of new populations we also warn against usage of neutral molecular

animal centromeres are epigenetically specified by a centromerespecific variant of histone h3 cenh3 aka cenpa unlike canonical histones that are invariant cenh3 proteins are accumulating substitutions at an accelerated rate this diversification of cenh3 is a conundrum since its role as the key determinant of centromere identity remains a constant across species here we ask whether naturally occurring divergence in cenh3 has functional consequences we performed functional complementation assays on cenh31 a null mutation in arabidopsis thaliana using untagged cenh3s from increasingly distant relatives contrary to previous results using gfptagged cenh3 we find that the essential functions of cenh3 are conserved across a broad evolutionary landscape cenh3 from a species as distant as the monocot zea mays can functionally replace a thaliana cenh3 plants expressing variant cenh3s that are fertile when selfed show dramatic segregation errors when crossed to a wildtype individual the progeny of this cross include hybrid diploids aneuploids with novel genetic rearrangements and haploids that inherit only the genome of the wildtype parent importantly it is always chromosomes from the plant expressing the divergent cenh3 that missegregate using chimeras we show that it is divergence in the fastevolving nterminal tail of cenh3 that is causing segregation errors and genome elimination furthermore we analyzed nterminal tail sequences from plant cenh3s and discovered a modular pattern of sequence conservation from this we hypothesize that while the essential functions of cenh3 are largely conserved the nterminal tail is evolving to adapt to lineagespecific centromeric constraints our results demonstrate that this lineagespecific evolution of cenh3 causes inviability and sterility of progeny in crosses at the same time producing karyotypic variation thus cenh3 evolution can contribute to postzygotic reproductive barriers © 2015 maheshwari et al the reintroduction

starch metabolism between dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species amylopectin  a branched glucose polymer  is the major component of starch and is responsible for its semicrystalline property plants synthesize starch with distinct amylopectin structures varying between species and tissues the structure determines starch properties an important characteristic for cooking and nutrition and for the industrial uses of starch amylopectin synthesis involves at least three enzyme classes starch synthases branching enzymes and debranching enzymes for all three classes several enzyme isoforms have been identified however it is not clear which enzymes are responsible for the large diversity of amylopectin structures here we tested whether the specificities of the debranching enzymes isa1 and isa2 are major determinants of speciesdependent differences in amylopectin structure by replacing the dicotyledonous arabidopsis isoamylases atisa1 and atisa2 with the monocotyledonous rice oryza sativa isoforms we demonstrate that the isa1 and isa2 are sufficiently well conserved between these species to form heteromultimeric chimeric arabidopsisrice isoamylase enzymes furthermore we were able to reconstitute the endospermspecific rice osisa1 homomultimeric complex in arabidopsis isa1isa2 mutants this homomultimer was able to facilitate normal rates of starch synthesis the resulting amylopectin structure had small but significant differences in comparison to wildtype arabidopsis amylopectin this suggests that isa1 and isa2 have a conserved function between plant species with a major role in facilitating the crystallization of preamylopectin synthesized by starch synthases and branching enzymes but also influencing the final structure of amylopectin © 2014 streb et al hydrochory the seed dispersal by water is a strategy used by many aquatic and some terrestrial plants to move into areas appropriate for establishment in this paper we model the hydrochory effects on the tunisian island populations of pancratium maritimum l using colored petri nets nineteen tunisian coastal sites were considered including fourteen mainland and five island sites the model was simulated for 400 thousand atlantic tunisian current cycles years snapshots of the island populations genetic makeup were taken for 50 200 and 400 thousand years the evolution of the obtained dendrograms showed a clear divide between the northern and southern island populations according to their estimated genetic makeup for the considered simulation

model species for the fagaceae family with extensive genomic resources including a physical map a dense genetic map and quantitative trait loci qtls for chestnut blight resistance these resources enable comparative genomics analyses relative to model plants we assessed the degree of conservation between the chestnut genome and other well annotated and assembled plant genomic sequences focusing on the qtl regions of most interest to the chestnut breeding community results the integrated physical and genetic map of chinese chestnut has been improved to now include 858 shared sequencebased markers the utility of the integrated map has also been improved through the addition of 42970 bac bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences spanning over 26 million bases of the estimated 800 mb chestnut genome synteny between chestnut and ten model plant species was conducted on a macrosyntenic scale using sequences from both individual probes and bac end sequences across the chestnut physical map blocks of synteny with chestnut were found in all ten reference species with the percent of the chestnut physical map that could be aligned ranging from 10 to 39  the integrated genetic and physical map was utilized to identify bacs that spanned the three previously identified qtl regions conferring blight resistance the clones were pooled and sequenced yielding 396 sequence scaffolds covering 139 mbp comparative genomic analysis on a microsytenic scale using the qtlassociated genomic sequence identified synteny from chestnut to other plant genomes ranging from 54 to 129  of the genome sequences aligning conclusions on both the macro and microsynteny levels the peach grape and poplar genomes were found to be the most structurally conserved with chestnut interestingly these results did not strictly follow the expectation that decreased phylogenetic distance would correspond to increased levels of genome preservation but rather suggest the additional influence of lifehistory traits on preservation of synteny the regions of synteny that were detected provide an important tool for defining and cataloging genes in the qtl regions for advancing chestnut blight

oldgrowth forest communities worldwide however the empirical evidence on this topic is limited we tested this hypothesis in the caatinga vegetation  a seasonally dry tropical forest restricted to northeast brazil we sampled 11653 individuals adults saplings and seedlings from 51 species in 29 plots distributed along a gradient of chronic disturbance the gradient was assessed using a chronic disturbance index cdi based on five recognized indicators of chronic disturbances proximity to urban center houses and roads and the density of both people and livestock we used linear models to test if mean effective number of lineages mean phylogenetic distance and phylogenetic dispersion decreased with cdi and if such relationships differed among ontogenetic stages as expected the mean effective number of lineages and the mean phylogenetic distance were negatively related to cdi and such diversity losses occurred irrespective of ontogeny yet the increase in phylogenetic clustering in more disturbed plots was only evident in seedlings and saplings mostly because clades with more descendent taxa than expected by chance eg euphorbiaceae thrived in more disturbed plots this novel study indicates that chronic human disturbances are promoting the phylogenetic impoverishment of the irreplaceable woody flora of the brazilian caatinga forest the highest impoverishment was observed in seedlings and saplings indicating that if current chronic disturbances remain they will result in increasingly poorer phylogenetically forests this loss of evolutionary history will potentially

with more species losing than winning 78 vs 45 winner and loser species were strongly differentiated by competitionrelated traits but traits related to soil nutrients and soil moisture also had some importance generally our results indicate a trend towards taller and more competitive species synthesis and applications despite conservation actions in order to maintain a socalled favourable conservation status vegetation in natura 2000 protected areas is still undergoing compositional changes overall autecological characteristics and trait differences between winners and losers match expectations given the contemporary anthropogenic pressures especially reduced livestock grazing atmospheric nitrogen deposition and increased soil moisture due to reduced drainage might also be

with that in kiwi red orange and some other species in which the biosynthesis of anthocyanin significantly influenced by low temperature as proved by previous studies low temperature regulatory elements were also found in the promoter region of the grapevine genes vvchs2 vvpal and vvf3h these findings indicate that the functions of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in grapevine are conservative

under low temperature stress the transcription analysis of the five genes and the content of polyphenols anthocyanins and flavonoids in grape skins were examined by using vitis vinifera l cv yongyou 1 and juxing berries as experimental material and treated at 4 °c and 25 °c for 24 h 48 h 72 h and 96 h the results showed that low temperature greatly enhanced the expression of the five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes low temperature greatly slowed down the decomposition of polyphenol anthocyanin and flavonoid in grape skins our study also found that cv juxing responded more sensitively to low

theory predicts that the longterm persistence of plant populations exposed to size reduction can be threatened by a loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding however several lifehistory and ecological traits can influence the response to population size reduction the reproductive patterns levels of genetic diversity and magnitude of inbreeding depression of the rare and fragmented

and ecology of the two species used for their aromatic and medicinal properties on réunion methods hand pollination experiments were conducted to determine the breeding system and to evaluate the potential for inbreeding depression in both species nuclear microsatellite markers were used to investigate selfing rates and levels of genetic diversity key results jumellea rossii revealed a mixedmating system and inbreeding depression at the germination stage δ  0·66 levels of genetic diversity were relatively high allelic richness ar  8·575 and expected heterozygosity he  0·673 in j fragrans selfing rates suggest a mainly outcrossing mating system genetic diversity was lower than in j rossii but not yet critically low ar  4·983 and he  0·492 probably because of the mainly outcrossing mating system and the relatively high density of individuals in the studied population jumellea fragrans did not show inbreeding depression and it is hypothesized that the population had progressively purged its genetic load during successive fragmentation events conclusions even if the persistence of the j fragrans population is not threatened in the short term its genetic diversity

phenolics that are either free or linked to polysaccharides thus they are tightly associated to cell wall loosening and stiffening they are members of large multigenic families mostly due to an elevated rate of gene duplication in higher plants resulting in a high risk of functional redundancy between them however proteomic and microtranscriptomic analyses have shown that ciii prx expression

optimal uniform delivery of water occurs when the distance between veins equals the depth of vein placement within the leaf away from the evaporative surface as presented here only angiosperms maintain this anatomical optimum across all leaf thicknesses and different habitats including sheltered environments where this optimization need not be required intriguingly basal angiosperm lineages tend to be underinvested hydraulically uniformly high optimization is derived independently in the magnoliids monocots and core eudicots gymnosperms and ferns including available fossils are limited by their inability to produce high vein densities the common association of ferns with shaded humid environments may in part be a direct evolutionary consequence of their inability to produce hydraulically optimized leaves some gymnosperms do approach optimal vein placement but only by virtue of their ability to produce thick leaves most appropriate in environments requiring water

investigate the relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters in australian plant species and to determine the associations in relation to predictions from population theory and previous global analyses location continent of australia methods we assembled a dataset of all known population genetic analyses of australian plants based on neutral markers and catalogued them according to key species attributes including range abundance range disjunction biome and growth form and genetic parameters mean number of alleles per locus observed and expected heterozygosity and population differentiation we determined relationships between species attributes and genetic parameters using a maximumlikelihood multimodel inference approach results we found many associations that were consistent with predictions species attributes with greatest effect on genetic diversity were range size growth form abundance and biome the most important attributes influencing genetic differentiation were range disjunction and abundance we found unexpected results in the effects of biome and growth form on genetic diversity with greater diversity in the eastern biome of australia and lower diversity in shrubs compared to trees main conclusions our analysis of genetic diversity of australian plants showed associations consistent with predictions based on population genetics theory with strong effects of range size abundance and growth form we identified a striking effect of range disjunction on population genetic differentiation an effect that has received little attention in the literature we also found some notable differences to global predictions which were most likely explained by confounding effects across variables this highlights that caution is needed when extrapolating trends from global analyses to regional floras identifying associations between species attributes and patterns of genetic diversity enables broadscale predictions to facilitate the

restored forest fragments is important for ensuring the maintenance of natural levels of genetic variation and connectivity gene flow among populations the application of restoration genetics often employs anonymous ‘fingerprinting’ markers in combination with limited sample sizes due to financial constraints here we used two such marker systems aflps amplified fragment length polymorphism and issrs intersimple sequence repeats to estimate populationlevel genetic variation of a frequently used species in restoration projects in new zealand mahoe melicytus ramiflorus violaceae we examined two rural and two urban forest fragments as potential local source populations to determine whether the māhoe population at the recently reconstructed ecosystem at waiwhakareke natural heritage park hamilton new zealand reflects the genetic variation observed in these four potential source populations both marker systems produced similar results and indicated that even with small population sizes levels of genetic variation at the heritage park were comparable with in situ populations however the aflps did provide finer resolution of the population genetic structure than issrs issrs which are less expensive and technically less demanding to generate than aflps may be sufficient for restoration projects where only a broad level of genotypic resolution is required we recommend the use of

objective the aim of this study was to assess how this time schedule can be extended without compromising regeneration in addition an easily measurable marker for successful cryopreservation was examined
materials and methods timing of cryopreservation was tested from august to february using dormant buds from both outdoor and indoor plants to find a marker water content and gene expression of hydrid aspens as well as environmental factors such as temperature temperature sum and light period were followed
results cryopreservation was successful from october to february when on an average at least 75  of the buds regenerated through micropropagation and there was no difference to nonfrozen controls significant genotypic variation was observed in october and february with regeneration rates of 61100  and 3798  respectively no marker for successful cryopreservation was found among the studied factors
conclusion the results provide flexibility for the undertaking of practical work with a recommendation that cryopreservation can be carried out from november to january  earlier than the current

either morphological similarity to g imbricatus or intermediateness in phenotypic characters the corm structure of flowering plants and seed capsules clearly distinguish the hybrid the new taxon is characterized by a lower generative reproduction than the parental species however hybrids produce 50 viable pollen and seeds which allows them to produce subsequent hybrid generations the weak

diversity in the study populations and applied principal component analysis and bayesian and coalescence methods to examine their population genetic structure and evolutionary history we found that the endangered bothnian bay population still harbors a reasonably high amount of genetic diversity and is differentiated from the geographically closest populations we show that puccinellia

and functioning of populations the conservation of genetic diversity is thus a priority especially for threatened or endangered species the importance of genetic variation however is dependent on the degree to which it translates into phenotypic variation for traits that affect individual performance and ecological processes this is especially important for predominantly clonal species as no single clone is likely to maximise all aspects of performance here we show that intraspecific genotypic diversity as measured using microsatellites is a strong predictor of phenotypic variation in morphological traits and shoot productivity of the threatened predominantly clonal seagrass posidonia australis on the east coast of australia biomass and surface area variation was most strongly predicted by genotypic richness while variation in leaf chemistry phenolics and nitrogen was unrelated to genotypic richness genotypic richness did not predict tissue loss to herbivores or epiphyte load however we did find that increased herbivore damage was positively correlated with allelic richness although there was no clear relationship between higher primary productivity and genotypic richness variation in shoot productivity within a meadow was significantly greater in more genotypically diverse meadows the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by environmental conditions varied among different genotypes and there was generally no variation in phenotypic traits among genotypes present in the same meadows our results show that genotypic richness as measured through the use of presumably neutral dna markers does covary with phenotypic variation in functionally relevant traits such as leaf morphology and shoot productivity the remarkably long lifespan of individual posidonia plants suggests that plasticity within genotypes has played an important role in the longevity of the species however the strong link between genotypic and phenotypic variation suggests that a range of genotypes is still the best case scenario for adaptation to and recovery from predicted environmental change © 2016 evans et al bletilla striata has been used as traditional chinese

automated largescale production and putative genetic stability of the regenerated plantlets the induction of somatic embryogenesis in peach palm can be achieved by using different explant sources including zygotic embryos immature inflorescences and thin cell layers from the young leaves and shoot meristems the choice of a particular explant depends on whether clonal propagation is desired or not as well as on the plant conditions and availability of explants protocols to induce and express somatic embryogenesis from different peach palm explants up to acclimatization of plantlets are

distributed in brazilian “cerrados” savannas but available genetic resources and potential for future breeding programs must be evaluated here we evaluated the reproductive system and pollenmediated gene flow in one generation of eugenia dysenterica germplasm collection of agronomy school federal university of goiás in goiânia city central brazil we collected leaves from all adults from the germplasm collection 682 plants and seeds 542 from 23 mothertrees genotypes were obtained for seven microsatellite loci genetic diversity was high and did not significantly differ between adults he  0777 and progeny arrays he  0617 our results showed that e dysenterica has an allogamous mating system in the germplasm collection tm  0957 but with high and significant biparental inbreeding tm − ts  0109 because sibs are very close to each other mating between closely related individuals is likely paternity correlation was also relatively high indicating a 119  probability that a randomly chosen pair of outcrossed progeny from the same array are full sibs the maximum pollen dispersal distance 224 m estimated using assignment test corresponded to the boundaries of the orchard we were able to assign the paternity to only 64  of the 349 seeds analyzed indicating potential pollen immigration to the germplasm collection the variance effective population size estimated for one maternal family in the germplasm collection nev  342 is very close to the theoretical maximum value for halfsibs nev  40 because e dysenterica has a long life cycle and generation time the maintenance of an effective population size of at least 100 in the germplasm collection is suggested which can be achieved by maintaining a seedtrees number around 30 individuals © 2016 springer international

them to cleavage or translational arrest so far the prediction of plant mirnatarget pairs generally relies on the use of empirical parameters deduced from known mirnatarget interactions results we developed comtar a web tool for the prediction of mirna targets that is mainly based on the conservation of the potential regulation in different species we used data generated from a pipeline applied to transcript datasets of 33 angiosperms that was used to build a database of potential mirna targets of different plant species the database contains information describing each mirnatarget pair their function and evolutionary conservation while the results are displayed in a userfriendly interface the tool also allows the search using new mirnas © 2014 the author 2014 in the present

characterization of this exotic germplasm at a genomewide scale will improve conservation efforts and its utilization in research and breeding programs therefore we phenotyped a representative core set of 374 ethiopian accessions at two locations for agronomic traits and characterized the genomes results using genotypingbysequencing we identified 148476 singlenucleotide polymorphism snp markers distributed across the entire genome over half of the alleles were rare frequency lt 005 the genetic profile of each accession was unique ie no duplicates and the average genetic distance among accessions was 070 based on population structure and cluster analyses we separated the collection into 11 populations with pairwise f st values ranging from 011 to 047 in total 198 accessions 53 were assigned to one of these populations with an ancestry membership coefficient of larger than 060 these covered 90 of the total genomic variation we characterized these populations based on agronomic and seed compositional traits we performed a cluster analysis with the sorghum association panel based on 26026 snps and determined that nine of the ethiopian populations expanded the genetic diversity in the panel genomewide association analysis demonstrated that these lowcoverage data and the observed population structure could be employed for the genomic dissection of important phenotypes in this core set of ethiopian sorghum germplasm conclusions the npgs ethiopian sorghum germplasm is a genetically and phenotypically diverse collection comprising 11 populations with high levels of admixture genetic associations with agronomic traits can be used to improve the screening of exotic germplasm for selection of specific populations we detected many rare alleles suggesting that this germplasm contains potentially useful undiscovered alleles but their discovery and characterization will require extensive effort the genotypic data available for these accessions provide a

role in plant development and stress adaptation its most prominent mutant defect is a unique hypertrophic shoot phenotype combining a strongly increased organ formation rate with enhanced meristem size and the formation of ectopic meristem poles however so far the role of amp1 in shoot development could not be assigned to a specific molecular pathway nor is its biochemical function resolved in this work we evaluated the level of functional conservation between amp1 and its human homolog hsgcpii a tumor marker of medical interest we show that hsgcpii cannot substitute amp1 in planta and that an hsgcpiispecific inhibitor does not evoke amp1specific phenotypes we used a chemical genetic approach to identify the drug hyperphyllin hp which specifically mimics the shoot defects of amp1 including plastochron reduction and enlargement and multiplication of the shoot meristem we assessed the structural requirements of hp activity and excluded that it is a cytokinin analog hptreated wildtype plants showed amp1related tissuespecific changes of various marker genes and a significant transcriptomic overlap with the mutant hp was ineffective in amp1 and elevated the protein levels of phavoluta consistent with the postulated role of amp1 in mirnacontrolled translation further supporting an amp1related mode of action our work suggests that plant and animal members of the m28 family

mediterranean france first we found an absence of genetic variation across the whole range of the species and that this species has a generalist ecological niche in ruderal habitats these findings should facilitate its practical conservation second a diachronic study revealed a decline of 50 of species distribution in the last twenty years however this species plays a dominant structural role in the urban network of green ways and on the banks of watercourses it thus provides ecological services associated with riverbank stabilization and natural corridors between peripheral natural areas and urban green spaces third sociological interviews revealed two contrasting perceptions of the species among local actors who view the plant either as a rare endemic species in regression or as a highly resistant even invasive weed of urban wastelands moreover this protected species is quasiabsent from urban planning documents and local actors show little comprehension of the need for

typically use species or more recently phylogenetic diversity pd as their analysis unit and produce a single map of observed diversity however observed biodiversity is not necessarily an indicator of significant biodiversity and therefore should not be used alone by applying a small number of additional metrics to pd with associated statistical tests we can determine whether more or less of the phylogeny occurs in an area whether branch lengths in an area are longer or shorter and whether more long or shortbranched endemism occurs in an area than expected under a null model location australian continent methods we used a phylogeny sampling 90 of australias angiosperm genera and 34 million georeferenced plant specimens downloaded from australias virtual herbarium avh to calculate pd relative phylogenetic diversity rpd and relative phylogenetic endemism rpe categorical analysis of neo and palaeoendemism canape and randomization tests were performed to determine statistical

combinations complements the previous interpretations of australias plant evolutionary history of conservation concern only 42 of the significant endemism cells found here overlap with existing nature

compounds that contribute to the protection of the plant host against herbivores some of these compounds such as ergot alkaloids are toxic to humans and have caused important epidemics throughout history the gene clusters encoding the proteins responsible for the synthesis of ergot alkaloids and lolines in clavicipitaceae have been elucidated notably homologs to these gene clusters can be found in distantly related species such as aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium expansum which diverged from clavicipitaceae more than 400 million years ago we here use a phylogenetic approach to analyze the evolution of these gene clusters we found that the gene clusters conferring the ability to synthesize ergot alkaloids and loline emerged first in eurotiomycetes and were then likely transferred horizontally to clavicipitaceae horizontal gene transfer is known to play a role in shaping the distribution of secondary metabolism clusters across distantly related fungal species we

disregarded when considering extinction risk under future climates location global methods in this paper we review and synthesize current knowledge about amongpopulation variation in physiological and morphological traits related to plant recruitment we outline the consequences of that variation for species persistence under climate change and discuss the implications for conservation management and restoration results the evaluated studies provide compelling evidence that amongpopulation variation in traits underpinning seedling emergence growth and establishment is widespread contrary to expectations environmental gradients do not appear to be reliable predictors of variation among populations and responses are often individualistic likewise wellestablished crossspecies patterns are not consistently reflected among populations within a species as the pattern of this variation is unpredictable we cannot make simple generalizations about how this variation is allocated across geographic ranges or the extent of environmental versus fixed genetic differences nor do these patterns clearly elucidate the potential for this variation to mitigate negative effects of climate

package genetically modified soybeans tolerant to glyphosate notill glyphosate and inorganic fertilizers this phenomenon has been widely spread in the country the notill package has been applied in large areas and has been used by tenants in a 6070 of cultivated lands thus those who were involved in developing management practices may not be the same as those who will face degradation issues related to those practices indeed most evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that the most widely distributed practices in the pampas region are actually producing severe soil degradation biological degradation is particularly important because soil biota is involved in numerous soil processes on which soil functioning relies affecting soil fertility and productivity for example soil meso and macrofauna are especially important in nutrient cycling and in soil structure formation and maintenance and they are key components of the network that links microbial process to the scale of fields and landscapes where ecosystem services are produced however the knowledge of the impact of different agricultural managements on soil meso and macrofauna in pampas agroecosystems is far from conclusive at this stage the reason for this lack of definite conclusions is that this area has been given less attention than in other parts of the world the response of soil fauna to agricultural practices is complex and taxadependent and there is a wide variety of practices in the main types of agricultural systems making generalizations difficult a review of the existing studies on soil meso and macrofauna in agroecosystems revealed that a agricultural soils regardless of farming system are strongly modified in biological aspects compared to the same soils without human interventions b

advances in understanding chromatin modifications implicated in plant stress response and identifying proteins involved in chromatinmediated transcriptional responses to stress are briefly presented in this review we then highlight how chromatinmediated gene expression changes can be coupled to the metabolic status of the cell since many of the chromatinmodifying proteins involved in

alleles in space analysis suggest that etenax populations within the mediterranean are largely connected and that there is an absence of largescale geographic structuring intraspecific variability was only 154 among samples and the mediterranean populations showed an almost complete lack of coi mtdna haplotype diversity thus our results suggest that etenax populations are well mixed and that a considerable amount of gene flow takes place even among populations that are a great distance apart as etenaxs ecological amplitude is wide and the species is therefore widespread in both natural and

enzyme in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate the epsps genes of allohexaploid wheat triticum aestivum aabbdd have not been well characterized herein the three homoeologous copies of the allohexaploid wheat epsps gene were cloned and characterized methods genomic and coding dna sequences of epsps from the three related genomes of allohexaploid wheat were isolated using pcr and inverse pcr approaches from soft white spring louise development of genomespecific primers allowed the mapping and expression analysis of taepsps7a1 taepsps7d1 and taepsps4a1 on chromosomes 7a 7d and 4a respectively sequence alignments of cdna sequences from wheat and wheat relatives served as a basis for phylogenetic analysis results the three genomic copies of wheat epsps differed by insertiondeletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms snps largely in intron sequences rtpcr analysis and cdna cloning revealed that epsps is expressed from all three genomic copies however taepsps4a1 is expressed at much lower levels than taepsps7a1 and taepsps7d1 in wheat seedlings phylogenetic analysis of 1190bp cdna clones from wheat and wheat relatives revealed that 1 taepsps7a1 is most similar to epsps from the tetraploid ab genome donor t turgidum 997  identity 2 taepsps7d1 most resembles epsps from the diploid d genome donor aegilops tauschii 100  identity and 3 taepsps4a1 resembles epsps from the diploid b genome relative ae speltoides 977  identity thus epsps sequences in allohexaploid wheat are preserved from the most two recent ancestors the wheat epsps genes are more closely related to lolium multiflorum and brachypodium distachyon than to oryza sativa rice conclusions the three related epsps homoeologues of wheat exhibited conservation of the exonintron structure and of coding region sequence but contained significant sequence variation within intron regions the genomespecific primers developed will enable future characterization of

devastating pathogen of potato crops making it one of the most economically important plant parasitic nematodes it is also an important model for the biology of cyst nematodes cyst nematodes and rootknot nematodes are the two most important plant parasitic nematode groups and together represent a global threat to food security results we present the complete genome sequence of g pallida together with transcriptomic data from most of the nematode life cycle particularly focusing on the life cycle stages involved in root invasion and establishment of the biotrophic feeding site despite the relatively close phylogenetic relationship with rootknot nematodes we describe a very different gene family content between the two groups and in particular extensive differences in the repertoire of effectors including an enormous expansion of the spry domain protein family in g pallida which includes the sprysec family of effectors this highlights the distinct biology of cyst nematodes compared to the rootknot nematodes that were until now the only sedentary plant parasitic nematodes for which genome information was available we also present indepth descriptions of the repertoires of other genes likely to be important in understanding the unique biology of cyst nematodes and of potential drug targets and other targets for their control conclusions the data and analyses we

divergence studying intraspecific partial ri can shed light on mechanisms underlying processes of population divergence intraspecific divergence can be driven by spatially stochastic accumulation of genetic differences following reduced gene flow resulting in increased ri with increased geographical distance or by local adaptation resulting in increased ri with environmental difference methods we tested for ri as a function of both geographical distance and ecological differentiation in iris atropurpurea an endemic israeli coastal plant we crossed plants in the netanya iris reserve population with plants from 14 populations across the species full distribution and calculated ri and reproductive success based on fruit set seed set and fraction of seed viability key results we found that total ri was not significantly associated with geographical distance but significantly increased with ecological distance similarly reproductive success of the crosses estimated while controlling for the dependency of each component on the previous stage significantly reduced with increased ecological distance conclusions our results indicate that the rise of postpollination reproductive barriers in i atropurpurea is more affected by ecological differentiation between populations than by geographical distance supporting the hypothesis that ecological differentiation is predominant over isolation by distance and by reduced gene flow in this species these findings also affect conservation management such as genetic rescue in the highly fragmented and endangered i atropurpurea © 2016

variation using mtdna and microsatellite markers across both native and invasive ranges to determine endemic genetic diversity within south africa identify the likely origin of invasive populations and test genetic divergence across australia results the data show that h destructor comprises a cryptic species complex in south africa with putative climatichost plant associations that may correspond to regional variation a lineage similar to that found near cape town has spread throughout western and eastern australia where populations remain genetically similar main conclusions tracing the invasion pathway of this economically important pest revealed cryptic lineages in south africa which points to the need for a taxonomic revision the absence of significant genetic

central problem in understanding cell biology and has been the focus of intense research in order to predict localization from amino acid sequence a myriad of features have been tried including amino acid composition sequence similarity the presence of certain motifs or domains and many others surprisingly sequence conservation of sorting motifs has not yet been employed despite its extensive use for tasks such as the prediction of transcription factor binding sitesresults here we flip the problem around and present a proof of concept for the idea that the lack of sequence conservation can be a novel feature for localization prediction we show that for yeast mammal and plant datasets evolutionary sequence divergence alone has significant power to identify sequences with nterminal sorting sequences moreover sequence divergence is nearly as effective when computed on automatically defined ortholog sets as on hand curated ones unfortunately sequence divergence did not necessarily increase classification performance when combined with some traditional sequence features such as amino acid composition however a posthoc analysis of the proteins in which sequence divergence changes the prediction yielded some proteins with atypical ie not mppcleaved matrix targeting signals as well as a few misannotationsconclusion we report the results of the first quantitative study of the effectiveness of evolutionary sequence divergence as a feature for protein subcellular localization prediction we show that divergence is indeed useful for prediction but it is not trivial to improve

the division charophyta a lineage closely related to land plants rlsblike sequences were not identified in any other algae suggesting that it may be specific to the evolutionary line leading to land plants the rlsb family occurs in single copy across most angiosperms although a few species with two copies were identified seemingly randomly distributed throughout the various taxa although perhaps correlating in some cases with known ancient whole genome duplications monocots of the order poales poaceae and cyperaceae were found to contain two copies designated here as rlsba and rlsbb with only rlsba implicated in the regulation of rbcl across the maize developmental gradient analysis of microsynteny in angiosperms revealed high levels of conservation across eudicot species and for both paralogs in grasses highlighting the possible importance of maintaining this gene and its surrounding genomic regions conclusions findings presented here indicate that the rlsb family originated as a unique gene in land plant evolution perhaps in the common ancestor of charophytes and higher plants purifying selection has maintained this as a highly conserved single or twocopy gene across most extant species with several conserved gene duplications together with previous findings this study suggests that rlsb has been sustained as an important regulatory protein throughout the course of land plant evolution while only rlsba has been directly implicated in rbcl regulation in maize rlsbb could have an overlapping function in the coregulation of rbcl or may have diverged as a regulator

often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56489 snp loci along with a reference library of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces results accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods i distancebased hierarchical clustering and ii modelbased maximum likelihood admixture analysis subsequently 30  of the identified accessions from farmers fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results the majority of the accessions 69  belonged purely to one of the 11 groups while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the fullset of markers suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique

genotypes with genetic similarity of one were found in the three germoplasm samples analyzed which ruled out the possibility of the occurrence of duplicates in the cluster analysis the dendrogram generated by the srap marker added three additional groups when compared with trap and distinguished two genotypes in the sample comprising morphoagronomically similar clones the trap and srap markers

five northern amp northeastern peripheral and 16 central populations using six microsatellite loci we found that populations resided at peripheries of the species possessed markedly decreased microsatellite diversity than those located in its center population size was observed to be positively correlated with microsatellite diversity moreover there are significantly positive correlations between levels of microsatellite diversity and distances from the northern and northeastern periphery of this species to investigate genetic structure and heterozygosity variation between generations of o rufipogon a total of 2382 progeny seeds from 186 maternal families were further assayed from three peripheral and central populations respectively peripheral populations exhibited significantly lower levels of heterozygosities than central populations for both seed and maternal generations in comparisons with maternal samples significantly low observed heterozygosity ho and high heterozygote deficit within populations fis values were detected in seed samples from both peripheral and central populations significantly lower observed heterozygosity ho and higher fis values were further observed in peripheral populations than those in central populations for seed samples the results indicate an excess of homozygotes and thus high inbreeding depression in peripheral populations conclusionssignificance our results together suggest that historical contraction of geographical range demographic changes and environmental conditions near the northern and northeastern margins of o rufipogon favor inbreeding and possibly selfing leading to the rapidly decreased effective population size genetic drift reduced gene flow and possible local selection consequently lead to lowered gene diversity accelerated genetic divergence and increased inbreeding depression found in peripheral populations of o rufipogon given these characteristics observed northern and northeastern

mediate the relationship between plant population size fitness and genetic diversity is fundamental to conservation many orchid species are threatened possibly due to their susceptibility to the consequences of habitat fragmentation and the associated decreasing population size one third of all orchids do not produce nectar to entice pollinators and this is believed to promote gene flow and outcrossing therefore we hypothesised that deceptive orchids are less susceptible to reductions in population size than rewarding species methods – we reviewed the available literature and used traditional and phylogenetically independent metaanalyses to explore relationships between population size fitness fruit set and genetic diversity key results – results showed that orchids in general are highly susceptible to the consequences of small population size fruit set significantly decreased in small populations of rewarding but not in deceptive species deceptive orchids were however as likely to lose genetic diversity in small populations even though significantly less genetic differentiation fst was present between populations of deceptive orchids finally we found that homozygosity did not relate with population size which may indicate a selection process against less fit homozygotes in small orchid populations conclusions – we conclude that reductions in population size most likely resulting from habitat loss and fragmentation represent major threats to the population viability of orchids fitness of rewarding orchids declines through ecological mechanisms whereas

mechanisms that maintain the expression state of a large number of genes all members of the two polycomb repressive complexes prc1 and prc2 are conserved during evolution and while invertebrates generally have one gene for each of these vertebrates have multiple homologues of them it remains unclear however if different vertebrate pcg homologues have distinct or overlapping functions we have identified and compared the sequence of pcg homologues in various organisms to analyze similarities and differences that shaped the evolutionary history of these proteins comparative analysis of the sequences led to the identification of several novel and signature motifs in the vertebrate homologues of these proteins which can be directly used to pick respective homologues our analysis shows that pcg is an ancient gene group dating back to prebilaterian origin that has not only been conserved but also expanded during the evolution of complexity the presence of unique motifs in each paralogue and its conservation for more than 500 ma indicates their functional relevance and probable unique role although this does not rule out completely any overlapping function our finding that these homologues only minimally overlap in their nuclear localization suggests that each pcg homologue has distinct function we further propose distinct complex formation by the pcg members taken

worldwide is threatened by the disease huanglongbing hlb caused by the phloemlimited pathogen candidatus liberibacter spp as a source of stable hlbresistance has yet to be identified there is considerable interest in characterization of novel diseaseassociated citrus genes results a gene family of small cyclic amphipathic peptides scampps in citrus is described the citrus genomes contain 100150 scampps genes approximately 50 of which are represented in the citrus est database these genes encode small 50 residue precursor proteins that are posttranslationally processed releasing 510 residue cyclic peptides the structures of the scampps genes are highly conserved with the small coding domains interrupted by a single intron and relatively extended untranslated regions some family members are very highly transcribed in specific citrus tissues as determined by representation in tissuespecific cdna libraries comparison of the ests of related scampps revealed an unexpected evolutionary profile consistent with targeted mutagenesis of the predicted cyclic peptide domain the scampps genes are displayed in clusters on the citrus chromosomes with apparent association with receptor leucinerich repeat protein arrays this study focused on three scampps family members with high constitutive expression in citrus phloem unexpectedly high sequence conservation was observed in

rule generation this paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the knoholem solution a collaborative project of the european commission in the scope of the 7th framework programme consisting of 13 partners across 6 countries the paper presents a novel rule generation methodology through the theoretical models the theoretical rule generation methodology will be explained encompassing the development of an energy model to the inclusion of rules within the building specific ontology these rules are stored in an ontological representation of the building which is queried by the facilities manager through a unique graphical interface allowing a negotiation of energy saving measures to occur following automatic actuation of the chosen rules the project aims to produce energy savings of up to 30 the rule generation will include the sensitivity analysis based on principle component analysis pca and multivariate regression analysis mra and the generation of rules through an artificial neural network ann embedded evolutionary optimization algorithm genetic algorithm using the most sensitive variables the methodology will be contextualized within the architecture of the knoholem project and applied to the first demonstration object a mixed use public building in the netherlands the results for the sensitivity analysisann training and ga will be presented then the

atf4 through paired upstream orfs uorfs plays an important role in eukaryotic gene regulation while it is typically induced by phosphorylation of eif2α atf4 translation can be also induced by expression of a translational inhibitor protein eif5mimic protein 1 5mp1 also known as bzw2 in mammals here we show that the 5mp gene is maintained in eukaryotes under strong purifying selection but is uniquely missing in two major phyla nematoda and ascomycota the common function of 5mp from protozoa plants fungi and insects is to control translation by inhibiting eif2 the affinity of human 5mp1 to eif2β was measured as being equivalent to the published value of human eif5 to eif2β in agreement with effective competition of 5mp with eif5 for the main substrate eif2 in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum rna interference studies indicate that 5mp facilitates expression of gadd34 a downstream target of atf4 furthermore both 5mp and atf4 are essential for larval development finally 5mp and the paired uorfs allowing atf4 control are conserved in the entire metazoa except nematoda based on these findings we discuss the phylogenetic and functional linkage between atf4 regulation

presence of three genetic compartments into the incipient plant cell after that these three genetic materials from host and symbiont suffered several rearrangements bringing on a complex interaction between nuclear and organellar gene products nowadays plastids harbor a small genome with ∼130 genes in a 100–220 kb sequence in higher plants plastid genes are mostly highly conserved between plant species being useful for phylogenetic analysis in higher taxa however intergenic spacers have a relatively higher mutation rate and are important markers to phylogeographical and plant population genetics analyses the predominant uniparental inheritance of plastids is like a highly desirable feature for phylogeny studies moreover the gene content and genome rearrangements are efficient tools to capture and understand evolutionary events between different plant species currently genetic engineering of the plastid genome plastome offers a number of attractive advantages as highlevel of

indicate that the conserved cterminal domain shared by flash yarp and mute recognizes the cterminal sequence of npat orthologues thus acting as a signal targeting proteins to hlbs finally we demonstrate that the cterminal domain of human flash can be directly joined with its nterminal region through alternative splicing the resulting 190amino acid miniflash despite lacking 90 of

bixin or annatto is a commercially important natural orangered pigment derived from lycopene that is produced and stored in seeds of bixa orellana l an enzymatic pathway for bixin biosynthesis was inferred from homology of putative proteins encoded by differentially expressed seed cdnas some activities were later validated in a heterologous system nevertheless much of the pathway remains to be clarified for example it is essential to identify the methylerythritol phosphate mep and carotenoid pathways genes results in order to investigate the mep carotenoid and bixin pathways genes total rna from young leaves and two different developmental stages of seeds from b orellana were used for the construction of indexed mrna libraries sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform and assembled de novo using velvet clc genomics workbench and cap3 software a total of 52549 contigs were obtained with average length of 1924 bp two phylogenetic analyses of inferred proteins in one case encoded by thirteen general singlecopy cdnas in the other from carotenoid and mep cdnas indicated that b orellana is closely related to sister malvales species cacao and cotton using homology we identified 7 and 14 core gene products from the mep and carotenoid pathways respectively surprisingly previously defined bixin pathway cdnas were not present in our transcriptome here we propose a new set of gene products involved in bixin pathway conclusion the identification and qrtpcr quantification of cdnas involved in annatto production suggest a hypothetical model for bixin biosynthesis that involve coordinated activation of some mep carotenoid and bixin pathway genes these findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating these pathways and will facilitate the genetic

increasing temperatures and earlier snowmelt have already caused upward migration of species changes in flowering phenology and increasing frost damage in plants thus significant loss of diversity in alpine areas is imminent plant migration and distribution shifts occur mainly via seeds which also provide the genetic diversity required for adaptation the ability of plants to shift their distribution in response to climate change will depend on seed dispersal germination and seedling success under new environmental conditions despite the critical importance of seeds and seedlings for species adaptation migration and persistence the majority of studies concerning climate change in alpine areas have mostly focused on the response of adult plants to warming temperature during seed development as well as the temperature to which seeds are exposed postdispersal has been found to have strong effects on seed longevity germination and seedling survival therefore global change particularly warming is expected to greatly impact regeneration of seeds in alpine areas despite evidence that climate change is advancing flowering phenology in several mountain ranges around the world under natural and artificial warming the cascade effects that early flowering can have on seeds and seedlings have been poorly studied indeed while a literature search on web of science using the search terms “germination” “alpine plants” and “climate change” revealed 50 studies of which only 7 directly examined the effect of warming on germination and establishment of seeds of alpine

opportunities for researchers agribusiness and consumers to reduce environmental risks associated with new pasture taxa we also emphasize four main approaches that governments could consider as they build new policies to limit weed risks including i national lists of taxa that are prohibited based on environmental risk ii a weed risk assessment for all new taxa iii a program to rapidly detect and control new taxa that invade natural areas and iv the polluterpays principle so that if a taxon becomes an environmental weed industry pays for its management there is mounting pressure to increase

purposes termed cooption notable examples include the cooption of a structure functioning in locomotion bacterial flagellum to one functioning in protein secretion type three secretion system similar cooptions can occur independently in distinct lineages we discovered a genomic region in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae that consists of a fragment of a bacteriophage genome the fragment encodes only the tail of the bacteriophage which is lethal toward strains of this species this structure is similar to a previously described structure produced by the related species pseudomonas aeruginosa the two structures however are not derived from the same evolutionary event thus they represent independent bacteriophage cooptions the coopted bacteriophage from p syringae is found in the

differences we identified 47 different individuals from 5 pods in the sog and 16 individuals in the ci with no matches found between the areas mitochondrial dna control region haplotype was shared by all individuals sampled within each pod suggesting that pods have a matrifocal social structure typical of this species whilst the lack of shared mitogenome haplotypes between the ci and sog individuals suggests that there was little or no female migration between groups kinship analysis detected no close kin between ci and sog individuals and low to zero contemporary gene flow isotopic values and organochlorine pollutant loads also suggest ecological differences between study areas we further found that one individual from a pod within the sog not seen in association with the other four pods and identified as belonging to a potential migrant lineage by genetic analyses had intermediate isotopic values and contaminant between the two study areas overall our results suggest a

revealed extensive dna rearrangements and poor conservation in noncoding dna in comparison between pepper lines fs4401 and jeju mitochondrial dnas contained the same complement of protein coding genes except for one additional copy of an atp6 gene ψatp62 in fs4401 in terms of genome structure we found eighteen syntenic blocks in the two mitochondrial genomes which have been rearranged in each genome by contrast sequences between syntenic blocks which were specific to each line accounted for 30380 and 17847 bp in fs4401 and jeju respectively the previouslyreported cms candidate genes orf507

in one such trait floral scent emission in the genus petunia solanaceae the increase in the quantity and complexity of the volatiles during the shift from bee to hawkmoth pollination was due to de

transcript levels for most enzymes of the phenylpropanoidbenzenoid pathway loss of cinnamatecoa ligase cnl function as well as a reduction in the expression of the myb transcription factor odo1 explain the loss of scent during the transition from moth to hummingbird pollination the cnl gene in the hummingbirdadapted species is inactive due to a stop codon but also appears to have undergone further degradation over time therefore we propose that loss of scent happened relatively early in the transition toward hummingbird pollination and probably preceded the loss of uvabsorbing flavonols

lowest under the heavy grazing the coefficient of gene differentiation gst of s grandis and s krylovii populations were 1682 and 2100 ° respectively these results suggest that the genetic diversity of

butterfly danaus plexippus of eastern north america have declined over the last 21 years three hypotheses have been posed to explain the decline habitat loss on the overwintering grounds in mexico habitat loss on the breeding grounds in the united states and canada and extreme weather events our objectives were to assess population viability determine which life stage season and geographical region are contributing the most to population dynamics and test the three hypotheses that explain the observed population decline we developed a spatially structured stochastic and densitydependent periodic projection matrix model that integrates patterns of migratory connectivity and demographic vital rates across the annual cycle we used perturbation analysis to determine the sensitivity of population abundance to changes in vital rate among life stages seasons and geographical regions next we compared the singular effects of each threat to the full model where all factors operate concurrently finally we generated predictions to assess the risk of host plant loss as a result of genetically modified crops on current and future monarch butterfly population size and extinction probability our yearround population model predicted population declines of 14 and a quasiextinction probability 1000 individuals 5 within a century monarch abundance was more than four times more sensitive to perturbations of vital rates on the breeding grounds than on the wintering grounds simulations that considered only forest loss or climate change in mexico predicted higher population sizes compared to milkweed declines on the breeding grounds our model predictions also suggest that mitigating the negative effects of genetically modified crops results in higher population size and lower extinction risk recent population declines stem from reduction in milkweed host plants in the united states that arise from increasing adoption of genetically modified crops and landuse change

seed we estimated 11 physical and chemical seed traits for each species and the phylogenetic relationships between the 23 hardwood trees variance partitioning revealed that considerable variation in foraging investment was attributable to seed traits alone 2773 and combined effects of seed traits and phylogeny of hardwood trees 555 a phylogenetic pca ppca on seed traits and tree phylogeny resulted in 2 global axes of traits that were phylogenetically autocorrelated at the family and genus level and a third local axis in which traits were not phylogenetically autocorrelated collectively these axes explained 3076 of the variation in squirrel foraging investments the first global ppca axis which produced large scores for seed species with thin shells low lipid and high carbohydrate content was negatively related to time to consume and cache seeds and travel distance to cache the second global ppca axis which produced large scores for seeds with high protein low tannin and low dormancy levels was an important predictor of consumption time only the local ppca axis primarily reflected kernel mass although it explained only 12 of the variation in trait space and was not autocorrelated among phylogenetic clades the local axis was related to all four squirrel foraging investments squirrel foraging behaviors are influenced by a combination of phylogenetically conserved

tephritidae it is a phytophagous species with broad host range and while not established in the mainland united states is a species of great concern for introduction despite the vast amount of information available from the closely related model organism drosophila melanogaster information at the genome and transcriptome level is still very limited for this species small rnas act as regulatory molecules capable of determining transcript levels in the cells the most studied small rnas are micro rnas which may impact as much as 30  of all protein coding genes in animals results we have sequenced small rnas srnas from the tephritid fruit fly b dorsalis oriental fruit fly specifically srnas corresponding to the 17 to 28 nucleotides long fraction of total rna sequencing yielded more than 16 million reads in total seventy five mirnas orthologous to known mirnas were identified as well as five additional novel mirnas that might be specific to the genera or to the tephritid family we constructed a gene expression profile for the identified mirnas and used comparative analysis with d melanogaster to support our expression data in addition several mirna clusters were identified in the genome that show conservancy with d melanogaster potential targets for the identified mirnas were also searched conclusions the data presented here adds to our growing pool of information concerning the genome structure and characteristics of true fruit flies it provides a basis for comparative studies with other dipteran and within tephritid species and can be used for applied research such as in the development of new control strategies based on gene silencing and transgenesis © 2015 calla and geib background arabinoxylans axs are major components of plant cell

south african association of botanists there is currently a great interest in studying functional traits in plants that aid to predict ecological interactions and responses of species to environmental or anthropological changes in ecosystems seedsmorphological traits play a relevant role along the whole life cycle of plants however they have not been well studied from functional perspective in different habitats especially in tropical dry areas where there is great diversity of species at high risk of threat the tumbesian dry forests occurring in the southwestern of ecuador and northwestern

reason it is urgent to generate information that may promote the conservation of forest genetic resources of tropical dry forests one of the most practical and immediate alternative is the collection and ex situ storage of seeds however in tropical dry habitats the morphological physiological and ecological traits of seeds are largely unknown which may prevent the performance of ex situ

stresses may alter their physiological and transcriptional responses to a subsequent stress suggesting a form of  stress memory  arabidopsis thaliana plants that have experienced multiple exposures to dehydration stress display transcriptional behavior suggesting  memory from an earlier stress genes that respond to a first stress by upregulating or downregulating their transcription but in a subsequent stress provide a significantly different response define the memory genes category genes responding similarly to each stress form the nonmemory category it is unknown whether such memory responses exists in other angiosperm lineages and whether memory is an evolutionarily conserved response to repeated dehydration stressesresults here we determine the transcriptional responses of maize zea mays l plants that have experienced repeated exposures to dehydration stress in comparison with plants encountering the stress for the first time four distinct transcription memory response patterns similar to those displayed by a thaliana were revealed the most important contribution is the evidence that monocot and eudicot plants two lineages that have diverged 140 to 200 m years ago display similar abilities to remember a dehydration stress and to modify their transcriptional responses accordingly the highly sensitive rnaseq analyses allowed to identify genes that function similarly in the two lineages as well as genes that function in speciesspecific ways memory transcription patterns indicate that the transcriptional behavior of responding genes under repeated stresses is different from the behavior during an initial dehydration stress suggesting that stress memory is a complex phenotype resulting from coordinated responses of multiple signaling pathwaysconclusions structurally related genes displaying the same memory responses in the two species would suggest conservation of the genes memory during the evolution of plants dehydration stress response systems on the other hand divergent transcription memory responses by genes encoding similar functions would suggest occurrence of speciesspecific memory responses the results provide novel insights into our current knowledge of how plants respond to multiple dehydration stresses as compared to a single exposure and may serve as a reference platform to study the functions of memory genes

investigation of the influence of pleistocene climate oscillation on mangrove population dynamics could enrich our knowledge about the evolutionary history during times of historical climate change which in turn may provide important information for their conservation results in this study phylogeography of a mangrove tree sonneratia alba was studied by sequencing three chloroplast fragments and seven nuclear genes a low level of genetic diversity at the population level was detected across its range especially at the range margins which was mainly attributed to the steep sealevel drop and associated climate fluctuations during the pleistocene glacial periods extremely small effective population size ne was inferred in populations from both eastern and western malay peninsula 44 and 396 respectively mirroring the fragility of mangrove plants and their paucity of robustness against future climate perturbations and human activity two major genetic lineages of high divergence were identified in the two mangrove biodiversity centres the indomalesia and australasia regions the estimated splitting time between these two lineages was 3153 million year ago mya suggesting a role for prepleistocene events in shaping the major diversity patterns of mangrove species within the indomalesia region a subdivision was implicated between the south china sea scs and the remaining area with a divergence time of 1874 mya corresponding to glacial vicariance when the emerged sunda shelf halted genetic exchange between the western and eastern coasts of the malay peninsula during pleistocene sealevel drops notably genetic admixture was observed in populations at the boundary regions especially in the two populations near the malacca strait indicating secondary contact between divergent lineages during interglacial periods these interregional genetic exchanges provided ample opportunity for the reuse of standing genetic variation which could facilitate mangrove establishment and adaptation in new habitats especially in the context of global climate changes conclusion phylogeogrpahic analysis in this study reveal that pleistocene sealevel fluctuations had profound influence on population differentiation of the mangrove tree s alba our study highlights the fragility of mangrove plants and offers a guide for the conservation of coastal mangrove communities experiencing

herbal plant background presentday climate change has altered the phenology the timing of periodic life cycle events of many plant and animal populations worldwide some of these changes have been adaptive leading to an increase in population fitness whereas others have been associated with fitness decline representing shortterm responses to an altered weather regime hitherto observed changes are largely explained by phenotypic plasticity however to track climatically induced shifts in optimal phenotype as climate change proceeds evolutionary capacity in key limiting climateand fitnessrelated traits is likely to be crucial in order to produce realistic predictions about the effects of climate change on species and populations a main target for conservation biologists is thus to assess the potential of natural populations to respond by these two mechanisms in this study we use a large 15year dataset on an ectotherm model the swedish sand lizard lacerta agilis to investigate how higher spring temperature is likely to affect oviposition timing in a high latitude population a trait strongly linked to offspring fitness and survival results with an interest in both the shortand potential longterm effect of rising temperatures we applied a random regression model which yields estimates of populationlevel plasticity and amongindividual variation in the average as well as the plastic response to temperature population plasticity represents capacity for shortterm adjustments whereas variation among individuals in a fitnessrelated trait indicates an opportunity for natural selection and hence for evolutionary adaptation the analysis revealed both populationlevel plasticity and individuallevel variation in average laying date in contrast we found no evidence for variation among females in their plastic responses to spring temperature which could demonstrate a similarity in responses amongst females but may also be due to a lack of statistical power to detect such an effect conclusion our findings indicate that climate warming may have positive fitness effects in this lizard population through an advancement of oviposition date this prediction is consistent over shorter and potentially also longer time scales as the analysis revealed both populationlevel plasticity and individuallevel variation in average laying date however the genetic basis for this variation would have to be examined in order to predict an evolutionary response © 2015 ljungström et al in malaysia limau purut citrus hystrix is mainly grown in home gardens

the north atlantic is currently thought to comprise 740 vascular plant species 92 of them endemics despite the fact that it is considered relatively well known there has been a 12  increase in the number of endemics in the last two decades relatively few of the cape verde plant lineages have been included in genetic studies so far and little is known about the patterns of diversification in the archipelago here we present an updated list for the endemic cape verde flora and analyse diversity patterns for three endemic plant lineages cynanchum globularia and umbilicus based on one nuclear its and four plastid dna regions in all three lineages we find genetic variation in cynanchum we find two distinct haplotypes with no clear geographical pattern possibly reflecting different ploidy levels in globularia and umbilicus differentiation is evident between populations from northern and southern islands isolation and drift resulting from the small and fragmented distributions coupled with the significant distances separating the northern and southern islands could explain this pattern overall our study suggests that the diversity in the endemic vascular flora of cape verde is higher than

we investigate the genetic distinctiveness and genetic structure of an iconic but yet taxonomically confusing species complex rhizophora mucronata and r stylosa across their distributional range by employing a suite of 20 informative nuclear ssr markers results our results demonstrated the general genetic distinctiveness of r mucronata and r stylosa and potential hybridization or introgression between them we investigated the population genetics of each species without the putative hybrids and found strong genetic structure between oceanic regions in both r mucronata and r stylosa in r mucronata a strong divergence was detected between populations from the indian ocean region indian ocean and andaman sea and the pacific ocean region malacca strait south china sea and northwest pacific ocean in r stylosa the genetic break was located more eastward between populations from south and east china sea and populations from the southwest pacific ocean the location of these genetic breaks coincided with the boundaries of oceanic currents thus suggesting that oceanic circulation patterns might have acted as a cryptic barrier to gene flow conclusions our findings have important implications on the conservation of mangroves especially relating to replanting efforts and the definition of evolutionary significant units in rhizophora species we outlined the genetic structure and identified geographical areas that require further investigations for both r mucronata and r stylosa these results serve as the foundation for the conservation genetics of r mucronata and r stylosa

method is necessary for comprehensive analysis of plant genomes this study analyzed the quality of dna obtained using paper fta cards prepared directly in the field when compared to the more traditional cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctabbased extraction methods from silicadried samples methods dna was extracted using fta cards according to the manufacturers protocol in parallel ctabbased extractions were done using the automated autogen dna isolation system dna quality for both methods was determined for 15 nonagricultural species collected in situ by gel separation spectrophotometry fluorometry and successful amplification and sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast gene markers results the fta card extraction method yielded less concentrated but also less fragmented samples than the ctabbased technique the cardextracted samples provided dna that could be successfully amplified and sequenced the fta cards are also useful because the collected samples do not require refrigeration extensive laboratory expertise or as many hazardous chemicals as extractions using the ctabbased technique discussion the relative success of the fta card method in our study suggested that this method could be a valuable tool for studies in plant population genetics and conservation biology that may involve screening of hundreds of individual plants the fta cards like the silica

proteomes and metabolomes these damageinduced changes are mediated by elaborate signaling networks which include receptorssensors calcium ca2 influx atp release kinase cascades reactive oxygen species ros and oxylipin signaling pathways in contrast our current knowledge of how fungi respond to injury is limited even though various reports indicate that mechanical damage triggers reproductive processes in fungi the damage response mechanism has been studied more in depth in trichoderma atroviride interestingly these studies indicate that the mechanical damage response involves ros ca2 kinase cascades and lipid signaling pathways here we compare the response to mechanical damage in plants animals and fungi and provide evidence that they appear to share signaling molecules and pathways suggesting evolutionary conservation across the three kingdoms © 2015 springerverlag berlin heidelberg ethylene is perceived following binding to endoplasmic reticulumlocalized receptors which in arabidopsis thaliana include etr1 ers1 ein4 etr2 and ers2 these receptors fall into two subfamilies based on conservation of features within their histidine kinase domain subfamily 1 contains etr1 and ers1 whereas subfamily 2 contains ein4 etr2 and ers2 because ethylene receptors are found only in plants this raises questions of when each receptor evolved here it is shown that subfamily 1 receptors encoded by a multigene family are present in all charophytes examined these being most homologous to etr1 based on their evolutionary relationship as well as containing histidine kinase and receiver domains in charophytes and physcomitrella patens one or more gene family members contain the intron characteristic of subfamily 2 genes indicating the first step in subfamily 2 receptor evolution ers1 homologs appear in basal angiosperm species after amborella trichopoda and in some early and basal angiosperm species and monocots in general it is the only subfamily 1 receptor present distinct ein4 and etr2 homologs appear only in core eudicots and ers2 homologs appear only in the brassicaceae suggesting it is the most recent receptor to evolve these findings show that a subfamily 1 receptor had evolved and a subfamily 2 receptor had begun to evolve in plants prior to the colonization of land and only these two existed up to the appearance of the first basal angiosperm the appearance of ers2 in the brassicaceae suggests ongoing evolution of the ethylene receptor family © 2015 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht members of the tristetraprolin ttp family of proteins participate in the regulation of mrna turnover after initially binding to aurich elements in target mrnas related proteins from most groups of eukaryotes contain a conserved tandem zinc finger tzf domain consisting of two closely spaced similar ccch zinc fingers that form the primary rna binding domain there is considerable sequence variation within the tzf domains from different family members within a single organism and from different organisms raising questions about sequencespecific effects on rna binding and decay promotion we hypothesized that tzf domains from evolutionarily distant species are functionally interchangeable the single family member expressed in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe zfs1 promotes the turnover of several dozen transcripts some of which are involved in cellcell interactions using knockin techniques we replaced the tzf domain of s pombe zfs1 with the equivalent domains from human ttp and the single family member proteins expressed in the silkworm bombyx mori the pathogenic yeast candida guilliermondii and the plant chromolaena odorata we found that the tzf domains from these widely disparate species could completely substitute for the native s pombe tzf domain as determined by measurement of target transcript levels and the flocculation phenotype characteristic of zfs1 deletion recombinant tzf domain peptides from several of these species bound to an aurich rna oligonucleotide with comparably high affinity we conclude that the tzf domains from ttp family members in these evolutionarily widely divergent species are functionally interchangeable in mrna binding and decay maintaining seed viability and germplasm integrity is a challenging task in conservation of plant genetic resources as seeds under storage will lose viability

aged wheat accessions under ex situ genebank storage since 1994 were sampled four recently regenerated wheat accessions were selected four random seed samples were chosen from each accession and three of them were exposed to three different accelerated ageing treatments these 32 seed samples in two germplasm sets displayed a range of germination rates from 4 to 98  thirtyseven microsatellite markers representing 21 wheat chromosomes were applied to screen 12 seeds of each sample and 449 ssr alleles were scored large ssr variation was found in each germplasm set there was 731  of the total ssr variation present among the naturally aged samples and 782  present among the accelerated ageing samples several analyses for genetic association consistently revealed no clear genetic separations among samples of high or low germination rates in both germplasm sets samples under different accelerated ageing treatments did not show much genetic differentiations from the original sample of each accession mantel tests revealed nonsignificant associations between ssr variability and sample germination rates for both germplasm sets these findings are useful for understanding seed deterioration under different ageing conditions and suggest that genomewide ssr variability may not provide sensitive markers for the monitoring of wheat seed viability © 2015 her majesty the queen in right of

domesticated species and thereby provide genetic resources that meet current and new challenges for farming in stressful environments these local ecotypes can show variable phenology and lowtomoderate edible yield but are often highly nutritious the main contributions of landraces to plant breeding have been traits for more efficient nutrient uptake and utilization as well as useful genes for adaptation to stressful environments such as water stress salinity and high temperatures we propose that a systematic landrace evaluation may define patterns of diversity which will facilitate

with lowmineralised waters although five populations have been recorded from spain and portugal in the past its current distribution may be reduced to only one population recurrently found in the last decade but threatened by herbivory and habitat degradation all this confirms the consideration of avellara as a threatened species with high phylogenetic singularity and makes it a flagship species

consequences for virulence evolution of multiple infections the progression of ash dieback in europe does not show spatial differences but studies show variation in susceptibility within host populations a probable consequence of genetic differences thus providing material for evolution of disease resistance or tolerance breeding programmes need to maintain the genetic diversity of fraxinus to enable it to withstand further threats such as climate change and the emerald ash borer because h fraxineus reproduces exclusively sexually the pathogen is likely to overcome a narrow

ecological and evolutionary consequences an understanding of hybridization is important for basic and applied sciences including conservation biology and agriculture herein we review and discuss ideas that are relevant to the recognition of hybrids and hybridization we supplement this discussion with simulations the ideas we present have a long history particularly in botany and clarifying them should have practical consequences for managing hybridization and gene flow in plants one of our primary goals is to illustrate what we can and cannot infer about hybrids and hybridization from molecular data in other words we ask when genetic analyses commonly used to study hybridization might mislead us about the history or nature of gene flow and selection we focus on patterns of variation when hybridization is recent and populations are polymorphic which are particularly informative for applied issues such as contemporary hybridization following recent ecological change we show that hybridization is not a singular process but instead a collection of related processes with variable outcomes and consequences thus it will often be inappropriate to generalize about the threats or benefits of hybridization from individual studies and at minimum it will be important to avoid categorical thinking about what hybridization and hybrids are we recommend potential sampling

main reason for retention of plastid genomes in epipogium is the necessity to translate messenger rnas mrnas of accd andor clpp proteins which are essential for cell metabolism however these genes are absent in plastomes of several plant species their absence is compensated by the presence of a functional copy arisen by gene transfer from plastid to the nuclear genome this suggests that there is no single set of plastidencoded essential genes but rather different sets for different species and that the retention of a gene in the plastome depends on the interaction between the nucleus and

setting appropriate conservation targets we used genetic data to identify population clusters and quantify gene flow over historical and contemporary time frames in the diamondback terrapin malaclemys terrapin this species has a long and complicated history with humans including commercial overharvesting and subsequent translocation events during the early twentieth century today terrapins face threats from habitat loss and mortality in fisheries bycatch to evaluate population structure and gene flow among diamondback terrapin populations in the chesapeake bay region we sampled 617 individuals from 15 localities and screened individuals at 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci our goals were to demarcate metapopulation structure quantify genetic diversity estimate effective population sizes and document temporal changes in gene flow we found that terrapins in the chesapeake bay region harbour high levels of genetic diversity and form four populations effective population sizes were variable among most population comparisons estimates of historical and contemporary terrapin gene flow were generally low m ≈ 001 however we detected a substantial increase in contemporary gene flow into chesapeake bay from populations outside the bay as well as between two populations within chesapeake bay possibly as a consequence of translocations during the early twentieth century

background in the past few decades noncoding rnas ncrnas have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes most studies of ncrnas in plants have focused on the identification of silencing micrornas mirnas and small interfering rnas sirnas another important family of ncrnas that has been well characterized in plants is the small nucleolar rnas snornas and the related small cajal bodyspecific rnas scarnas both target chemical modifications of ribosomal rnas rrnas and small nuclear rnas snrnas in plants the snorna genes are organized in clusters transcribed by rna pol ii from a common promoter and subsequently processed into mature molecules the promoter regions of snorna polycistronic genes in plants are highly enriched in two conserved cisregulatory elements cres telobox and site ii which coordinate the expression of snornas and ribosomal protein coding genes throughout the cell cycle results in order to identify novel ncrna genes we have used the snorna teloboxsite ii motifs combination as a functional promoter indicator to screen the arabidopsis genome the predictions generated by this process were tested by detailed exploration of available rnaseq and expression data sets and experimental validation as a result we have identified several snornas scarnas and orphan snornas we also show evidence for 16 novel ncrnas that lack similarity to any reported rna family finally we have identified two dicistronic genes encoding precursors that are processed to mature snorna and mirna molecules we discuss the evolutionary consequences of this result in the context of a tight link between snornas and mirnas in eukaryotes conclusions we present an alternative computational approach for noncoding rna detection instead of depending on sequence or structure similarity in the whole genome screenings we have explored the properties of promoter regions of wellcharacterized ncrnas interestingly besides expected ncrnas predictions we were also able to recover single precursor arrangement for snornamirna accompanied by analyses performed on rice sequences we conclude that such arrangement might have interesting functional and evolutionary

associated with plant defense βamyrin is present at low levels in the roots of diploid oat avena strigosa oat roots also synthesize the βamyrin derived triterpene glycoside avenacin a1 which provides protection against soilborne diseases the genes for the early steps in avenacin a1 synthesis saponindeficient 1 and 2 sad1 and sad2 have been recruited from the sterol pathway by gene duplication and neofunctionalization here we show that sad1 and sad2 are regulated by an ancient root developmental process that is conserved across diverse species sad1 promoter activity is dependent on an l1 box motif implicating sterollipidbinding class iv homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors as potential regulators the metabolism of βamyrin is blocked in sad2 mutants which therefore accumulate abnormally high levels of this triterpene the accumulation of elevated levels of βamyrin in these mutants triggers a superhairy root phenotype importantly this effect is manifested very early in the establishment of the root epidermis causing a greater proportion of epidermal cells to be specified as root hair cells rather than nonhair cells together these findings suggest that simple triterpenes

dispersal distances between mother and pollen source were calculated a large proportion of detected pollination events 424 were observed within a radius of 50m of the mother tree the comparison of different tree densities indicated that with decreasing density the pollen dispersal distances increase we observed pollination over long distances with a maximum of 107km which is probably one of the reasons for a low spatial genetic structure within the m sylvestris population and a stable genetic diversity in the offspring incorporating microsatellite data of 21 apple cultivars a hybridization frequency of nearly 8 was determined with decreasing tree density the number of hybridization events increased based on the results of our study an enhancement of the density of existing m sylvestris populations is recommend to reduce the likelihood of hybridization the production of young plants originated from seeds collected after open pollination is not advisable instead of that the seedlings for further reintroduction measures should be produced by controlled crossings in seed orchards to ensure true type m sylvestris individuals © niab 2015 understanding the genetic structure of species

to their own premrnas to induce alternative splicing that leads to formation of unstable mrna isoforms this provides an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that regulates the cellular homeostasis of these factors we have described such an autoregulatory mechanism for two core protein components u11–48k and u11u12–65k of the u12dependent spliceosome this regulatory system uses an atypical splicing enhancer element termed usse u11 snrnpbinding splicing enhancer which contains two u12type consensus 5´ splice sites 5´ss evolutionary analysis of the usse element from a large number of animal and plant species indicate that usse sequence must be located 25–50 nt downstream from the target 3´ splice site 3´ss together with functional evidence showing a loss of usse activity when this distance is reduced and a requirement for rsdomain of u11–35k protein for 3´ss activation our data suggests that u11 snrnp bound to usse uses exon definition interactions for regulating alternative splicing however unlike standard exon definition where the 5´ss bound by u1 or u11 will be subsequently activated for splicing the usse element functions similarly as an exonic splicing enhancer and is involved only in upstream splice site activation but does not function as a splicing donor additionally our evolutionary and functional data suggests that the function of the 5´ss duplication within the usse elements is to allow binding of two u11u12 disnrnps that stabilize each others’ binding through putative mutual interactions © 2015 taylor  francis group llc background threatened species

a stable and specialized habitat of treeless screes and cliffs this study therefore used s sponhemica as a model species to compare quantitative and molecular variation in order to explore 1 the relative importance of drift and selection in shaping the distribution of quantitative genetic variation along climatic gradients 2 the relationship between plant fitness quantitative genetic variation molecular genetic variation and population size and 3 the relationship between the differentiation of a trait among populations and its evolvability methods genetic variation within and among 22 populations from the whole distribution area of s sponhemica was studied using rapd random amplified polymorphic dna markers and climatic variables were obtained for each site seeds were collected from each population and germinated and seedlings were transplanted into a common garden for determination of variation in plant traits key results in contrast to previous results from rare plant species strong evidence was found for divergent selection most population trait means of s sponhemica were significantly related to climate gradients indicating adaptation quantitative genetic differentiation increased with geographical distance even when neutral molecular divergence was controlled for and qinfstinf exceeded finfstinf for some traits the evolvability of traits was negatively correlated with the degree of differentiation among populations qinfstinf ie traits under strong selection showed little genetic variation within populations the evolutionary potential of a population was not related to its size the performance of the population or its neutral genetic diversity however performance in the common garden was lower for plants from populations with reduced molecular genetic variation suggesting inbreeding depression due to genetic erosion conclusions the findings suggest that studies of molecular and quantitative genetic variation may provide complementary insights important for the conservation of rare species the strong differentiation of quantitative traits among populations shows that selection can be an important force for structuring

of the morro bay kangaroo rat including taxonomy and genetics soil type and burrows history of decline primary causes of decline breeding in the wild and in captivity habitat restoration and threats in particular there are two primary causes of decline first development urban agricultural and industrial has resulted in direct loss of habitat second in the absence of fire the early seral stages of coastal dune scrub optimal habitat have matured to later successional stages of vegetation which are denser and with substantially fewer annual food plants and which negatively impact the locomotion

rates ranging from 11 to 93 the assayed samples showed substantial changes in scutellum but not aleurone the nuclei observed in the majority of the scutellum cells of the na seed samples of lower germination rates were longer in size and less visible while the scutellum cell morphology or arrangement remained unchanged in contrast longer aa treatments resulted in the loss of scutellum cell structure collapse of cell layers and disappearance of honey comb arrangements these nuclei and structural changes were consistent with the dna assessments of nuclear alternations for the selected wheat samples interestingly the sample seed germination loss was found to be associated with the reductions in the scutellum nuclear content and with the increases in the scutellum nuclei length to width ratio these findings are significant for understanding the process of wheat seed deterioration and are also useful for searching for sensitive seed aging signals for developing tools to monitor

sequence analyses showed that the soybean genome contains two pgip loci each locus is composed of three clustered genes that are induced following infection with the fungal pathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum lib de bary and remnant sequences of pgip genes the analyzed homeologous soybean genomic regions about 126 kb that include the pgip loci are strongly conserved and this conservation

ecotoxic heavy metalloids is ubiquitous around the globe concentration of these heavy metalloids in soil has increased drastically over the last three decades thus posing risk to the environment and human health some technologies have long been in use to remediate the hazardous heavy metalloids conventional remediation methods for heavy metalloids are generally based on physical chemical and biological approaches which may be used in combination with one another to cleanup heavy metalloid contaminated soils to an acceptable and safe level this review summarizes the soil contamination by heavy metalloids at a global scale accumulation of heavy metalloids in vegetables to toxic levels and their regulatory guidelines in soil in this review we also elucidate and compare the pool of

on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals however traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life

in the taihang mountains china which were dominated by robinia pseudoacacia black locust quercus variabilis chinese cork oak and platycladus orientalis chinese arborvitae respectively a consistent pattern was found among the three types of stands being that the density of seedlings was positively correlated with the overstory canopy cover and negatively correlated with the covers of shrub herb and litter layers while a positive correlation between the density of seedlings and stand age was found for the conifer stands negative correlations were found for the two types of broadleaf stands correlations between the density of saplings and the stand attributes were not consistent among the three types of stands the two types of broadleaf stands had higher densities of seedlings and saplings than the conifer stands while the broadleaf stands had adequate recruits for regeneration the conifer stands did not have enough recruits our findings suggest that the overstory canopy should be prevented from being disturbed any reduction of the canopy cover will decrease the recruits and affect the regeneration © 2014 yang et al the paper discussed the change of oases cropping systems

analyzed homeologous gene expression of a major salttolerance gene highaffinity k transporter 15 hkt15 we observed that under salt stress neo6x exhibited higher fitness than both of its parental genotypes due to inheritance of favorable traits like higher germination rate from the 4x parent and the stronger root na retention capacity from the 2x parent moreover expression of the dsubgenome hkt15 homeolog which is responsible for na removal from the xylem vessels showed an immediate transcriptional reprogramming following allohexaploidization ie from constitutive high basal expression in ae tauschii 2x to saltinduced expression in neo6x this phenomenon was also witnessed in the nat6x an integrated analysis of 92 traits showed that under saltstress conditions neo6x resembled more closely the 2x than the 4x parent suggesting that the salt stress induces enhanced expressivity of the dsubgenome homeologs in the synthetic hexaploid wheat collectively the results suggest that

kinome with particular focus on gene duplication events we matched arabidopsis proteins to a hiddenmarkov model of eukaryotic kinases and computed a phylogeny of 942 arabidopsis protein kinase domains and mapped their origin by gene duplicationresults the phylogeny showed two major clades of receptor kinases and soluble kinases each of which was divided into functional subclades based on this phylogeny association of yet uncharacterized kinases to families was possible which extended functional annotation of unknowns classification of gene duplications within these protein kinases revealed that representatives of cytosolic subfamilies showed a tendency to maintain segmentally duplicated genes while some subfamilies of the receptor kinases were enriched for tandem duplicates although functional diversification is observed throughout most subfamilies some instances of functional conservation among genes transposed from the same ancestor were observed in general a significant enrichment of essential genes was found among genes encoding for protein kinasesconclusions the inferred phylogeny allowed classification and annotation of yet uncharacterized kinases the prediction

morphological and phenological traits samples of original collected seed were grown and compared with plants from first and second ex situ generation with commercial cultivars and landraces being included for purposes of comparison variance analysis and tukey multiple comparisons of means showed that the commercial cultivars and landraces were clearly distinct from the wild populations and were excluded from the further analysis despite the fact that the wild accessions were collected from a geographically delimited region in norway they exhibited significant differences in several of the measured traits the main phenotypic patterns remain after ex situ regenerations however the mean values for four of the examined traits across accessions did change significantly from one generation to the next two of the eight accessions had significantly changed from one generation to the next a tendency was observed across all the studied traits the results were discussed in terms of regeneration circumstances observed changes appeared to be directional going from populations with predominantly wild morphological types towards plants more closely resembling the commercial cultivars such a directional change implies that selection or gene flow has been acting on the accessions during regeneration rather than random changes owing to genetic drift copyright © niab 2015

artificial selection on traits of interest regardless of their genetic architecture yet still today most models used to study and streamline this process overlook genetic interactions in this study we determined the conditions in which a target genotype can be fixed when truncation selection is applied on an epistatic trait previous studies have shown that reciprocal sign epistasis with two fitness peaks of unequal height involves multiple equilibrium states ie below one critical parameter value such as a critical recombination rate one genotype may be fixed and above it another one may be fixed using a haploid bilocus model we identified which genotype would be fixed and how quickly in an infinite population selected for a phenotypic trait subject to reciprocal sign epistasis with unequal peak heights depending on two criteria the recombination rate and percentage of selected individuals the critical parameter values at which bistability sets in were also calculated these results were complemented by stochastic simulations in finite populations our results confirmed that in the case of fitness under reciprocal sign epistasis high recombination rates induce blockage at the local optimum or attainment of an equilibrium state between the two peaks however if linkage disequilibrium is negative in the initial population recombination is necessary to create the most favorable genotype therefore in this case reciprocal sign epistasis favors nonnull recombination rates particularly if selection is intense © 2015 elsevier ltd corydalis tomentella franch papaveraceae a species

individuals of this species was carried out employing 12 issr and 11 srap markers a total of 59 7164 and 79 8314 polymorphic bands were detected by 12 issr primers and 11 srap primer pairs respectively high similarity for patterns of genetic diversity and clustering of individuals was observed using two issr and srap marker systems and combined data range of genetic similarity by issr markers was 014 to 095 by srap markers was 014 to 090 while this range varied from 018 to 091 by issr  srap in the upgma cluster analysis issr srap and issr  srap we always found two clusters the first cluster included 22 individuals and the second contained seven individuals the results demonstrated that both issr and srap methods were suitable for discriminating among the studied individuals and the srap markers were more efficient and preferable the results of multiple regression analysis revealed statistically significant association between rust resistance and some molecular markers that they can provide clues for identification of the individuals with higher rust resistance the molecular markerbased study of genetic diversity suggests that the germplasm studied representing the

most effective and economical approach © 2014 elsevier bv most globalwarming models predict an altitudinal movement of plants this upward migration of lowland species will surely result in contact with related species inhabiting highmountain ecosystems we propose that an overlooked consequence of this upland movement is the possibility for interspecific hybridization between narrowly endemic alpine plants and widely distributed lowland plants genetic swamping due to introgressive hybridization might even lead to the genetic extinction of the endemic species without any apparent detrimental demographic effect unfortunately this phenomenon has long been ignored in the ecological literature probably because is widely assumed that the ecological effects of climate change are more detrimental than its genetic effects we tested our idea by searching for humaninduced hybridization in a worldwide hotspot biodiversity the highmountains of the sierra nevada southeastern spain about 25  of the endemic flora is already hybridizing in these mountains mostly with widespread lowland congeners some species are even already threatened due to genetic swamping it is thereby urgent

they tend to be smaller and more easily isolated than central populations the indochinese gray langurs living in the wuliang mountains of southwestern china which form the northernmost peripheral population of the species have ecological and behavioral features distinct from those of other such populations we conducted semistructured interviews and field surveys on the population census and distribution of indochinese gray langurs in jingdong county from july 2013 to november 2013 these interviews provided the first largescale data about the distribution and habitat use of these langurs

secondary forest with higher density and isolated individual trees in pasture progeny from both old growth and secondary forest contexts were predominantly outcrossed tm100 and experienced low levels of biparental inbreeding tmts000004 in contrast to predictions our results indicated that the mating patterns of v ferruginea are relatively robust to density differences between old growth and

meridionale is a wild plant producing edible fruits in the mountain areas of northern south america however the fruits of this species has been under an unsustainable extraction and there is a growing interest of establishing this species as a crop nevertheless the information about its breeding system is scarce which is essential for its sustainable management and conservation this research aimed to study the floral and reproductive biology of v meridionale in natural conditions and to analyze the importance of pollinators on its reproduction in two wild populations of v meridionale in the states of cundinamarca and boyacá in the oriental cordillera of colombia for this we have made different observations and experiments to describe its flower morphology floral phenology pollen viability stigma receptivity pollenovule ratio and nectar production to study its reproductive system we performed experiments of flower emasculation pollinator exclusion and hand pollination selfand crosspollination we found that although the flowers have poricidal anthers the release of pollen could occur easily without vibration v meridionale shows a large floral display long floral longevity and has femalebiased nectar production the pollenovule ratio was of 571±133 which classified the species as facultative xenogamy this result agreed with the pollination experiments because the plants produced fruits by agamospermy selfing and outcrossing however we registered a strong inbreeding depression observed in high rates of fruit abortions after selfpollination unlike of selfpollinating fruits the plant retains those produced by crosspollination since its formation the floral traits showed by this species are mechanisms to favor a more diverse guild of floral visitors than only insects able to buzzpollination in addition these floral traits may enhance the pollination probability and reduce geitonogamy moreover the inbreeding depression suggests that v meridionale promotes outcrossing as its main reproductive strategy therefore pollinators particularly bees are essential for this species reproduction and conservation and are critical in the maintenance of its genetic

a certain vegetative period while c18 remains vegetative under long day conditions plant growth of both genotypes was monitored during 5 subsequent weeks starting one week before flower initiation occurred in c17 axillary bud outgrowth was measured weekly and samples of shoot apex stem and axillary buds were taken during the first two weeks we combined auxin and cytokinin measurements by

floral transition coinciding with decreased auxin and increased cytokinin levels in the subapical axillary buds as opposed to c17 c18 maintained strong apical dominance with vegetative growth throughout the experiment here high auxin levels and decreasing cytokinin levels in axillary buds and stem were measured a differential expression of several branching genes accompanied the different hormonal change and bud outgrowth in c17 and c18 this was clear for the strigolactone biosynthesis gene cmmax1 the transcription factor cmbrc1 and the dormancy associated gene cmdrm1 that all showed a decreased expression in c17 at floral transition and an increased expression in c18 with continuous vegetative growth these results offer a case study for chrysanthemum showing an altered cytokinin to auxin balance and differential gene expression between vegetative growth with apical dominance and transition to generative growth with loss of apical dominance and axillary bud outgrowth this suggests a conservation of several aspects of the hormonal and genetical regulation of bud outgrowth in chrysanthemum furthermore 15 previously uncharacterised genes in chrysanthemum were described in

protein complex that binds to spindle microtubules mts recruits the potent mt nucleator γtubulin and thereby promotes the centrosomeindependent mt generation within mitotic and meiotic spindles augmin is essential for acentrosomal spindle assembly which is commonly observed during mitosis in plants and meiosis in female animals in many animal somatic cells that possess centrosomes the centrosome and augmindependent mechanisms work cooperatively for efficient spindle assembly and cytokinesis yeasts have lost the augmin genes during evolution it is hypothesized that their robust mt nucleation from the spindle pole body spb the centrosomeequivalent structure in fungi compensates for the lack of augmin intriguingly however a gene homologous to an augmin subunit aug6augf has been found in the genome of filamentous fungi which has the spb as a robust mt nucleation centre here we aimed to clarify if the augmin complex is present in filamentous fungi and to identify its role in mitosis by analysing the aug6like gene in the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans we found that it forms a large complex with several other proteins that share weak but significant homology to known augmin subunits in a nidulans augmin was enriched at the spb and also associated with spindle mts during mitosis however the augmin gene disruptants did not exhibit growth defects under normal checkpointdeficient or mtdestabilised conditions moreover we obtained no evidence that a nidulans augmin plays a role in γtubulin recruitment or in mitotic cell division our study uncovered the

whether terrestrial riparian species are affected in the same way by barriers here we analysed the genetic structure of a threatened riparian shrub based on 20 microsatellite markers and 1176 individuals collected from 34 localities in four alpine rivers in europe isar lech rhine and tagliamento the catchments comprised a variety of potential barriers to gene flow for terrestrial riparian

extensive study across north america for more than a century and indicates widespread bidirectional genetic introgression we found evidence fire is creating habitat conditions leading to isolation between nesting goldenwinged warblers and bluewinged warblers this effect is likely the result of fires ability to promote grass cover and suppress woody plants leading to habitat use partitioning between goldenwinged warblers and bluewinged warblers in addition to minimizing contact between the species fire is creating habitat conditions on mixed sites that greatly favors goldenwinged warblers over bluewinged warblers fire provides a plausible explanation for the original split in these sister species and its near elimination from eastern north america provides at least a partial explanation for the goldenwinged warblers extensive rangewide decline fire also provides a potential conservation tool by isolating goldenwinged warbler and bluewinged warbler nesting populations if

more consistent with morphological criteria to delimit species reconstruction of the ancestral area for the genus was ambiguous with both the western guiana shield and the atlantic coastal areas containing early divergent lineages but most speciation events appeared to have happened in the western guiana shield where most extant diversity is present dispersal events into the western amazon and the andes 1545 ma and the eastern guiana shield 0422 ma were followed by speciation events in these regions dispersal events between the amazon and atlantic rain forest occurred at least three times independently however dispersals into new areas were limited and most regions were found to be phylogenetically clustered altitudinal and habitat shifts happened multiple times independently but ecological traits were found to be phylogenetically conserved implying that such shifts were not the cause of lineage divergence the result that most speciation events happened in the western guiana shield where whitesand habitats predominate in both lowlands and highlands and which has been less affected by pleistocene climatic change coupled with the result that ecological traits are

two forms which are characteristic of hygric or xeric habitats and which exploit different host plants and host ants the status of these two forms has been the subject of considerable controversy populations of the two forms are usually spatially distinct but at răscruci in romania both forms occur on the same site syntopically we examined the genetic differentiation between the two forms using eight microsatellite markers and compared with a nearby hygric site Şardu our results showed that while the two forms are strongly differentiated at răscruci it is the xeric form there that is most similar to the hygric form at Şardu and bayesian clustering algorithms suggest that these two populations have exchanged genes relatively recently we found strong evidence for population substructuring caused by high within host ant nest relatedness indicating very limited dispersal of most ovipositing females but not association with particular host ant species our results are consistent with the results of larger scale phylogeographic studies that suggest that the two forms represent local ecotypes specialising on different host plants each with a distinct flowering

instead be an interfacial helix this would place the conserved fxvtxk motif in the plant cell cytosol where it could function as a substrategating loop as occurs in bcsa to define the functional importance of the cesa region containing fxvtxk we tested five parallel mutations in arabidopsis thaliana cesa1 and physcomitrella patens cesa5 in complementation assays of the relevant cesa mutants in both organisms the substitution of the valine or lysine residues in fxvtxk severely affected cesa function in arabidopsis roots both changes were correlated with lower cellulose anisotropy as revealed by pontamine fast scarlet analysis of hypocotyl inner cell wall layers by atomic force microscopy showed that two altered versions of atcesa1 could rescue cell wall phenotypes observed in the

apparent limited possibilities for the host to create variability at this particular s gene analysis of xa41t conservation across the oryza genus enabled us to hypothesize scenarios as to its

control soil erosion but has become increasingly popular as the practice conserves soil moisture reduces fossil fuel use lowers cost and once established increases yield in some countries such as australia ca is practised on more than two thirds of the total cropped area the new practice is more sustainable and environment friendly as microbial activity and soil organic matter increase thus improving soil health and crop yields optimised crop rotations in ca help control weeds and improve nutrient availability thus contributing to farming system sustainability however most crop cultivars currently grown under ca have been developed on conventional or full tillage and it is likely that valuable genetic variation for adaptation to ca has been lost some genetic studies found significant genotype × tillage practice interactions under ca however the trend has not been consistent over environments or across studies the relatively weak genetic response to tillage practice is probably a function of selection under conventional tillage over thousands of years even early farmers tilled the soil and made seed selections for the next crop based on the best adapted and most vigorous plants if a stronger response to ca is to be achieved then germplasm resources that extend adaptive trait variability must be characterised and integrated with crop breeding it is vital that crop

genotyping and farmer surveys to understand the extent distribution and management of tartary buckwheat fagopyrum tataricum gaertn diversity in its center of origin in yunnan province china we found genetic evidence of gene flow in tartary buckwheat throughout the study area with small but statistically significant regional and villagelevel components we also found genetic differentiation by seed color although most farmers reported exchanging seed in localized kinship networks our results imply homogenizing gene flow is occurring yi ethnic farmers tend to plant more buckwheat than nonyi farmers and we found that in some communities yi farmers serve as seed sources for farmers of other ethnicities different tartary buckwheat varieties did not have different end uses rather farmers maintained varietal diversity in order to protect crop yield and quality individual farmers’ seed exchange practices reflect their ideas about components of seed quality as well as priorities in

demonstrated that d1 and d2 are homologs of the staygreen sgr genes from other plant species and were duplicated as a result of the most recent wgd in soybean transcriptional analysis showed that both d1 and d2 were more highly expressed in older tissues and chlorophyll degradation and programmed cell deathrelated genes were suppressed in a d1d2 double mutant this situation indicated that these genes are probably involved in the early stages of tissue senescence investigation of genes that flank d1 and d2 revealed that evolution within collinear duplicated blocks may affect the conservation of individual gene pairs within the blocks moreover we found that a long terminal repeat retrotransposon gmd2in resulted in the d2 mutation further analysis of this retrotransposon family showed that

the presence of an unusually large number of lhc genes in this species some gene units were homologous to other units within single loci of the polyprotein genes whereas intergenic homologies between

germination percentage and 135 17 of the variance in mean germination time respectively our results demonstrated that elevated temperature would lead to a significant increase in germination percentage and an accelerated germination multifactorial anovas showed that the three major factors contributing to differences in germination percentage and mean germination time in this alpinesubalpine meadow were phylogenetic attributes temperature and seed size explained 105 47 and 14 of the variance in germination percentage independently respectively and explained 149 135 and 27

and prrbcs increased during needle maturation and was associated with the progressive loss of h3k9me3 h3k27me3 and the increase in ach4 the maturationrelated silencing of prshmt4 was correlated with increased h3k9me3 levels and the repression of prcsdp2 to the interplay between ach4 h3k27me3 h3k9me3 and specific dna methylation the employ of hat and hdac inhibitors led to a further determination

patterns of fa in leaves and flowers between populations indicating a homogenous level of stress between populations that differed for other traits fa and the other traits were not related including heterozygosity heterozygosity was not related to individual fitness traits with the exception of plant height in accordance with other studies we found that the role of fa as a tool for assessing the conservation status of a species or population should be reconsidered however we conclude that a low level of fa should not automatically be considered an indicator of good conservation status or low level of stress because in species that evolved in highly stable environments it may indicate a scarce ability to plastically respond to environmental changes as a consequence of environmental and

as revealed by a comparison with 22 other narrow endemic species from this region despite the fact that all naufraga populations are located at a maximum distance of 10 km in a straight line a strikingly strong population differentiation was found for aflp markers which is explained by longterm isolation likely related to shortrange pollination and dispersal strategies of the species while the species is not genetically impoverished species distribution modelling and microclimatic monitoring revealed that narrow ecological requirements underlie the current extreme rarity of naufraga and

data the method requires not only evolutionary conservation of candidate tfbss and sets of strongly coexpressed genes but also that the genes in a gene set share the same gene ontology term so that they are involved in the same biological function in addition we developed another method to predict maize tftfbs pairs using known tftfbs pairs in arabidopsis or rice from these efforts we predicted 1340 novel tfbss and 253 new tftfbs pairs in the maize genome far exceeding the 30 tftfbs pairs currently known in maize in most cases studied by both methods the two methods gave similar predictions

wall deposition among these the arabidopsis vascularrelated unknown protein1 vup1 gene encodes a predicted protein of 24 kd with no annotated functional domains but containing domains that are highly conserved in tracheophytes here we show that the vup1 expression pattern determined by promoterβglucuronidase reporter gene expression is associated with vascular tissues while vup1 lossoffunction

vulnerability to climate change here we conduct a specieslevel assessment of climate change vulnerability for a sample of australias threatened species and map the distribution of species affected by each factor driving climate change vulnerability across the continent almost half of the threatened species assessed were considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change amphibians being the most vulnerable group followed by plants reptiles mammals and birds species with more restricted distributions were more likely to show high climate change vulnerability than widespread species the main factors driving climate change vulnerability were low genetic variation dependence on a particular disturbance regime and reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat the geographic distribution of the species impacted by each driver varies markedly across the continent for example species impacted by low genetic variation are prevalent across the humandominated southeast of the country while reliance on particular moisture regimes is prevalent across northern australia our results show that actions to address climate adaptation will need to be spatially appropriate and that

unclear we investigated diversity gene flow and contemporary pollenmediated gene immigration in the rare narrowly distributed endemic shrub calothamnus quadrifidus ssp teretifolius this taxon occurs in an internationally recognized biodiversity hotspot subjected to recent humaninduced fragmentation and the condition of the remnants ranges from intact to highly degraded using microsatellites we found that inbreeding historically low gene flow and significant population differentiation have characterized the genetic system of c quadrifidus ssp teretifolius inbreeding arises from selfpollination a small amount of biparental inbreeding and significant correlation of outcross paternity but fecundity was high suggesting populations might have purged their lethals paternity analyses show that pollinators can move pollen over degraded and intact habitat but populations in both intact and degraded remnants had few pollen parents per seed parent and low pollen immigration genetic diversity did not differ significantly between intact and degraded remnants but there were signs of genetic bottlenecks and reduced diversity in some degraded remnants overall our study suggests humaninduced fragmentation has not significantly changed the mating system or pollen immigration to remnant populations and therefore genetic connectivity need not be the highest conservation

limited cryopreservation and in vitro culture of plant tissues are two tools that can be brought into service for ex situ plant conservation they are especially important for the longterm preservation of genetic diversity of species for which traditional seed banking is not workable such species have been termed exceptional species and they include species with recalcitrant seeds as well as species that produce few or no seeds the ability to propagate and cryopreserve tissues from multiple genotypes can bring endangered species into stable longterm storage and provide material that can be used for restoration several species under study at crew provide examples including asimina tetramera deeringothamnus pulchellus and d rugelii three endemic florida pawpaws that have seeds and have been reported as recalcitrant hedeoma todsenii and mespilus canescens species from new mexico and arkansas respectively that are not producing seed and crotalaria avonensis and ranunculus aestivalis endemic species from florida and utah respectively for which few seeds have been available these species also illustrate some of the challenges of propagating and maintaining multiple genotypes of genotypic variation in propagation and survival through cryopreservation and of survival through acclimatization and outplanting however they also illustrate the potential of these techniques for providing tissues for storage and plants for restoration when traditional methods are not adequate as these tools are applied to more species these methods should become more efficient and effective

other fungi and plants in which nuclear accumulation of the pathwayspecific transcription factors only occur in the presence of nitrate yna1p and yna2p are constitutively nuclear in h polymorpha yna2p is needed for this nuclear accumulation and yna1p is incapable of strictly positioning in the nucleus without yna2p in vivo dna footprinting and chip analyses revealed that the permanently nuclear

between a glutinosa and a incana among the eleven pedigrees in one of the two natural a glutinosa populations where also planted a incana was present their height growth was variable and only one of the three fructified with seeds showing a normal germination success these individuals can be hybrids with intermediate features between the parental species or they may display the natural variability of the latter with overlapping traits other individuals with intermediate leaf shape but less intermediate features for other leaf bud and infructescence characters found in the pedigrees of additional four a glutinosa populations may point to the relative wide natural variability for leaf shape within the parental species alternatively these may concern backcrossed individuals or

including hijacking the host encoded mirnas to target agos two host encoded mirnas namely mir168 and mir403 that target agos have been described in the model plant arabidopsis and such a mechanism is thought to be well conserved across plants because ago sequences are well conserved results we show that the interaction between ago mrnas and mirnas is speciesspecific due to the diversity in sequences of two mirnas that target agos sequence diversity among corresponding target regions in ago mrnas and variable expression levels of these mirnas among vascular plants we used mirna sequences from 68 plant species representing 31 plant families for this analysis sequences of mir168 and mir403 are not conserved among plant lineages but surprisingly they differ drastically in their sequence diversity and expression levels even among closely related plants variation in mir168 expression among plants correlates well with secondary structureslength of loop sequences of their precursors conclusions our data indicates a complex ago targeting interaction among plant lineages due to mirna sequence diversity and sequences of mirna targeting regions among ago mrnas thus leading to the assumption that the perturbations by viruses that use host mirnas to target antiviral agos can only be speciesspecific we also show that rapid evolution and likely loss of expression of mir168 isoforms in tobacco is related to the insertion of mitelike transposons between mirna and mirna sequences a possible mechanism showing how mirnas are lost in few plant lineages even though other close

brazil historically prioritized the model of ex situ conservation held in cold storage in vitro conservation and living collections in the field this type of conservation captures the evolutionary moment in which the collection was made but plants not continue the evaluation this characteristic reveals the limitations of this type of conservation to provide faster answers in a time of crisis related to environmental changes for example currently fao recognizes that genetic diversity should be maintained not only in genebanks as well as in local agricultural systems where the participation of farmers is crucial the itpgrfa binding instrument signed by brazil in 2001 makes this a line of action and research required for all members but how to implement it in this paper we present a reflection on the complementarities between the models of ex situ conservation and on farm taking the proposed shared management of ex situ collections as example of incipient process of construction the scientific and institutional paths that enable new ways of interaction between traditional farmers and agricultural research institutions in order to preserve not only the germplasm but also processes that generate agrobiodiversity rare plant reintroductions are designed to increase the number of individuals in the wild but can also improve genetic diversity of populations reducing both shortterm and longterm extinction risks we used microsatellites developed for the genus pseudophoenix h wendl ex sarg to determine how reintroduced plants of the endangered pseudophoenix sargentii h wendl ex sarg planted in the florida keys in the early 1990s contributes to the population genetic structure of the species we sampled 108 individuals representing wild and reintroduced populations in the florida keys and from the ex situ collection at fairchild tropical botanic garden the wild stand on elliott key and the reintroduced individuals on long key displayed evidence of genetic drift inbreeding and decreased gene flow in contrast the ex situ plants and reintroduced individuals on elliott key displayed low inbreeding and higher heterozygosity all populations deviated significantly from hardyweinberg equilibrium all pairwise fst and gst values were significant except comparisons between certain age classes on elliott key analysis of molecular variance partitioned 878 of the genetic variation within populations overall reintroduced plants have contributed to greater heterozygosity of the stand on elliot key finally our work shows that the ex situ collection includes wild

a prevalent conservation practice that offers substantial benefits to soil and water quality however winter cereal cover crops preceding corn may diminish beneficial rotation effects because two grass species are grown in succession here we show that rye cover crops host pathogens capable of causing corn seedling disease we isolated fusarium graminearum f oxysporum pythium sylvaticum and p torulosum from roots of rye and demonstrate their pathogenicity on corn seedlings over 2 years we quantified the densities of these organisms in rye roots from several field experiments and at various intervals of time after rye cover crops were terminated pathogen load in rye roots differed among fields and among years for particular fields each of the four pathogen species increased in density over time on roots of herbicideterminated rye in at least one field site suggesting the broad potential for rye cover crops to elevate corn seedling pathogen densities the radicles of corn seedlings planted following a rye cover crop had higher pathogen densities compared with seedlings following a winter fallow management practices that limit seedling disease may be required to allow corn yields to respond positively to improvements in soil quality brought about by cover cropping © 2016 the american phytopathological society the plant circadian clock controls various physiological phenomena that are important for adaptation to natural daynight cycles many components of the circadian clock have been identified in arabidopsis thaliana the model plant for molecular genetic studies recent studies revealed evolutionary conservation of clock components in green plants homologues of clockrelated genes have been isolated from lemna gibba and lemna aequinoctialis and it has been demonstrated that these homologues function in the clock system in a manner similar to their functioning in arabidopsis while clock components are widely conserved circadian phenomena display diversity even within the lemna genus in order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing a semitransient bioluminescent reporter system using a particle bombardment method circadian bioluminescent reporters were introduced into nine strains representing five duckweed species spirodela

freerunning conditions under entrainment atcca1luc showed similar diurnal rhythms in all strains this suggests that the mechanism of biological timing under daynight cycles is conserved throughout the evolution of duckweeds under freerunning conditions we observed circadian rhythms of atcca1luc zmubq1luc and camv35sluc these circadian rhythms showed diversity in period length and sustainability

forests of eastern and southern india the plant is used by the common people in certain regions of india for the treatment of various diseases including bronchial asthma cancer dysentery hay fever inflammation rheumatism arthritis and dermatitis the plant has also been employed to cure cold psoriasis whooping cough seborrhea anaphylaxis respiratory infections and leucopenia and is an inhibitor of the schultzdale reaction the active principle of this plant lies in its leaves and roots which are known to exhibit emetic cathartic laxative expectorant diaphoretic and purgative properties the presence of pharmacologically active alkaloids viz tylophorine tylophorinine tylophorinidine imparts medicinal value to the plant tylophorine exhibits strong antiinflammatory activity while tylophorinidine is a potent antitumor alkaloid of tylophora indiscriminate collection of this plant from its natural habit low seed germination potential difficulty in propagation through vegetative cuttings have resulted in the rapid depletion of the natural strands of this plant thus giving it an endangered status micropropagation or plant tissue culture approaches are one of the potent alternative strategies for conservation as well as utilization of this valuable germplasm various biotechnological approaches have also been employed for improvement of this plant species using genetic transformation and somaclonal variation for the commercial exploitation of valuable alkaloids the present chapter deals with the literature concerning the medicinal importance of tylophora its

of microsatellite loci is considered as a costeffective approach for developing microsatellite markers for new species the aim of this work was to examine the transferability of some ssr markers of two arecaceae species astrocaryum aculeatum and elaeis oleifera in acrocomia aculeata out of the total markers analysed 44 of the markers successfully amplified the genomic dna in a aculeata of which 26 were polymorphic detecting a range of three to eight alleles with an average of 45 per locus high average percentage of polymorphic loci p  712 per provenance was obtained within a range of 57100 detecting genetic variation in a aculeata germplasm collections the polymorphic markers detected a positive inbreeding coefficient f0 per locus revealing heterozygote deficiency in the accessions that were analysed as the crossamplification was at family level in which the taxonomic distance is relatively wider between the sources a aculeatum and e oleifera and the target a aculeata species the amplification success was relatively low however the results are promising and implicated that high crossamplification success could be achieved at species or genus level in a aculeata the markers

toolbox has advanced our understanding of the structure functioning and evolution of forest tree genomes aims and methods this review highlights some of the discoveries and applications that “omics” technologies have made possible for forest trees over the past 10 years results in this review we start by our current understanding of genome evolution and intricacies of gene regulation for reproduction development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses we then skim over advances in interactome analysis and epigenomics the knowledge of the extent of genetic variation within and

diversity of plant communities are controversial showing either a positive or negative linear relationship based on community data collected from forty 5 m65 m plots invaded by sphagneticola trilobata in eight cities across hainan island china we found s trilobata decreased plant community diversity once its cover was beyond 10 we demonstrated that the effects of invasivenative plants on the plant diversity of communities invaded by s trilobata were curvilinear these effects which showed peaks under different degrees of vegetation cover appeared not only for s trilobata and all invasive plants but also for all native plants invasive plants primarily had negative effects on plant diversity when they became abundant at a much lower cover level less than 35 compared with the native plants over 60 thus it is necessary to distinguish a range for assessing the effects of plants especially invasive plants our results also confirmed that the invasion intensity of invasive alien plants increased with the intensity of local economic development we highlight and further discuss the critical importance of curvilinear effects of biological invasion to provide ideas regarding the conservation of

by 5 to 9 days and development of floral buds and sepals was severely affected compared to wild type arabidopsis plants this suggests that the botfl1like gene may play roles in flowering time and flower morphological structure in b oldhamii the botfl1like gene driven by the 35s promoter almost fully rescued the phenotype of the tfl1 mutant apart from the number of rosette inflorescences

elevation genes containing snps identified as under environmental selection were diverse including aquaporin and abscisic acid genes as well as genes with ontologies relating to responses to environmental stressors such as water deprivation and salt stress redundancy analysis demonstrated that only a small proportion of the total genetic variance was explained by environmental variables

translocation programs used to vitalize or restore declining and extinct populations founder diversity may also improve the ability of invasive species to establish and subsequently spread in environments outside of their native community and enhance the ability of pathogens and parasites to colonize and invade the environment constituted by their hosts it is argued that exchange of ideas methodological approaches and insights of the role of diversity for establishment in different contexts may further our knowledge vitalize future research and improve management plans in different

in belgium lorraine in france and luxembourg the preservation of this species however is threatened by an invasive pathogen that particularly targets and kills young alder individuals the objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of a glutinosa at this local level with the aim of assisting the conservation and replanting strategies and to determine if a germplasm collection comprising individuals from the same crossborder area captures the diversity present in the region nuclear simple sequence repeat ssr and chloroplastic dna cpdna markers were used to analyze four local wild populations and the germplasm collection which is representative of two river catchments and six legal provenance regions three populations distant from the studied area were also included a panel of 14 nuclear ssr loci revealed high allelic diversity and very low differentiation among wild populations mean fst  0014 the germplasm collection displayed a range of alleles that were representative of the different populations and no significant differentiation between the germplasm collection and the local wild populations was observed making this collection as far as allelic diversity is concerned suitable for providing trees for riverbank replanting programs using ssr markers various statistical approaches consistently indicated the lack of a significant geographical structure at the level of the river catchments or provenance regions in contrast two cpdna haplotypes were detected and displayed a crossborder geographically structured distribution that could be taken into account in defining new crossborder provenance regions © 2016 the authors background insect pest control is challenged by insecticide resistance and negative impact on ecology and health one promising pest specific alternative is the generation of transgenic plants which express double stranded rnas targeting essential genes of a pest species upon feeding the dsrna induces gene silencing in the pest resulting in its death however the identification of efficient rnai target genes remains a major challenge as genomic tools and breeding capacity is limited in most pest insects impeding wholeanimalhighthroughputscreening results we use the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum as a screening platform in order to identify the most efficient rnai target genes from about 5000 randomly screened genes of the ibeetle rnai screen we identify 11 novel and highly efficient rnai targets our data allowed us to determine go term combinations that are predictive for efficient rnai target genes with proteasomal genes being most predictive finally we show that rnai target genes do not appear to act synergistically and that protein sequence conservation does not correlate with the number of potential off target sites conclusions our results will aid the identification of rnai target genes in many pest species by providing a manageable number of excellent candidate genes to be tested and the proteasome as prime target further the identified go term combinations will help to identify efficient target genes from organ specific

similar to their differentiation from allied species these results including high incidences of private alleles suggest historical divergence among cryptic taxa within emicrotheca and erostrata population groups in erostrata have recently been taxonomically recognized as two subspecies our study suggests that emicrotheca should also be reassessed as two taxa or considered as two esus and the

in four rice promoter regions on gene regulation was investigated using promoterreporter gene constructs with and without retrotransposons differences in expression levels of gus and egfp reporter genes in forward orientation and rfp in reverse orientation were evaluated in rice plants with transient expression employing quantitative rtpcr analysis histochemical gus staining and egfp and rfp fluorescent microscopy the presence of sine in the promoter 1 p1 resulted in higher expression levels of the reporter genes whereas the presence of line in p2 or gypsy ltr retrotransposon in p3 reduced expression of the reporter genes furthermore the sine in p1 acts as an enhancer in contrast with the line in p2 and the gypsy ltr retrotransposon in p3 which act as silencers ctaa and cgg motifs in these retrotransposons are the likely candidates for the downregulation compared to tctt motif sine which is a candidate for the upregulation of gene expression the effect of

been intensively investigated in humans and other animal systems sine identification has been carried out only in a limited number of plant species this lack of information is apparent especially in nonmodel plants whose genome has not been sequenced yet the aim of this work was to produce a specific bioinformatics pipeline for analysing second generation sequence reads of a nonmodel species and identifying sines we have identified for the first time 227 putative sines of the olive tree olea europaea that constitute one of the few sets of such sequences in dicotyledonous species the identified sines ranged from 140 to 362 bp in length and were characterised with regard to the occurrence of the trna domain in their sequence the majority of identified elements resulted in single copy or very lowly repeated often in association with genic sequences analysis of sequence similarity allowed us to identify two major groups of sines showing different abundances in the olive tree genome the former with sequence similarity to sines of scrophulariaceae and solanaceae and the latter to sines of salicaceae a comparison of sequence conservation between olive sines and ltr retrotransposon families suggested that sine expansion in the genome occurred especially in very ancient times before ltr retrotransposon expansion and presumably before the separation of the rosids to which oleaceae belong from the asterids besides providing data on olive sines our results demonstrate the suitability of the pipeline employed for sine identification applying this pipeline will favour further structural and functional analyses on these relatively unknown elements to be performed also in other plant species even in the absence of a reference genome and will allow establishing

been utilized by rice farmers in southeast asia for many centuries the finger knife persisted in many traditional cultures long after the introduction of the sickle a tool which provided farmers with the means to execute a much faster harvest several theories in interpretative archaeology have attempted to account for this rejection of more modern technological innovations these theories which include communitybased social organization ideas and practical reasons for the continued use of the finger knife are presented in this paper here i suggest an alternate theory based on a reinterpretation of existing research and fusion of existing theories the primary reason for the historical and continued use of the finger knife is for seed selection through a centuries old tradition of plant breeding though i accept the accuracy of the practical and communitybased sociocultural reasons for the use of the finger knife put forth by other authors i suggest that seed selection and genetic improvement was the driving factor in the use of the finger knife indeed intricate planting and harvesting rituals which both ensured and encouraged varietal conservation and improvement coevolved with the use of the finger knife as the primary harvest tool due to its unique ability to aid the farmer in the art and science of seed selection when combined with previous ideas this interpretative theory based on the connection between ethnoagronomy and material culture may provide a more complete picture of the story around the persistence of the finger knife in traditional ricegrowing cultures in southeast asia i focus my theory on the terracebuilding ifugao people in the mountainous cordillera region of northcentral philippines however to put the use of the

of the unique processes that occur during its ontogeny including syncytial development at early stages rice endospermless 1 enl1 develops seeds lacking an endosperm but carrying a functional embryo the enl1 endosperm produces strikingly enlarged amoeboid nuclei these abnormal nuclei result from a malfunction in mitotic chromosomal segregation during syncytial endosperm development the molecular identification of the causal gene revealed that enl1 encodes an snf2 helicase family protein that is orthologous to human plk1interacting checkpoint helicase pich which has been implicated in the resolution of persistent dna catenation during anaphase enl1venus enhanced yellow fluorescent protein yfp localizes to the cytoplasm during interphase but moves to the chromosome arms during mitosis enl1venus is also detected on a threadlike structure that connects separating sister chromosomes these observations indicate the functional conservation between pich and enl1 and confirm the proposed role of pich although enl1 dysfunction also affects karyokinesis in the root meristem enl1 plants can grow in a field and set seeds indicating that its indispensability is tissuedependent notably despite the wide conservation of enl1pich among eukaryotes the loss of function of the enl1 ortholog in arabidopsis chr24 has only marginal effects on endosperm nuclei and results in normal plant

botanical society of japan and springer japan premise of the study the introduction of nonnative taxa into areas occupied by conspecifics can lead to local extinction of native taxa via habitat modification and competitive dominance and be exacerbated by outbreeding depression or the formation of invasive hybrid lineages following intraspecific gene flow the expansion of eurasian phragmites australis into tidal wetlands of north america has been accompanied by a dramatic decline of native p australis with few relic populations remaining along the atlantic coastline of the united states particularly in the virginia portion of the chesapeake bay
methods we sampled populations from the york river and its two major tributaries to determine the pattern of phragmites invasion and identify remnant native populations that warrant conservation we used chloroplast dna haplotypes and nuclear dna microsatellite profiles to classify individuals as belonging to the native or introduced lineage
key results although native phragmites stands were identified in the brackish upstream reaches of the two york river tributaries the majority of phragmites stands surveyed contained the introduced lineage we also identified a single putative hybrid plant based on its microsatellite profile this plant possessed the native cpdna haplotype and was located in an otherwise native phragmites stand that is adjacent to an isolated patch of introduced phragmites
conclusions although evidence of field hybridization between native and introduced lineages of phragmites in north america is still relatively rare the continued encroachment of the introduced lineage into native wetlands may increase the likelihood of future hybrid formation careful genetic monitoring to identify remnant native and potential hybrid phragmites is essential for prioritizing ongoing

with characterized biochemical activities in sporopollenin and pollen coat biosynthesis the tapetum which forms the innermost sporophytic cell layer of the anther and envelops developing pollen plays an essential role in sporopollenin and pollen coat formation recent studies show that several tapetumexpressed genes encode enzymes that metabolize fatty acid derived compounds to form putative sporopollenin precursors including tetraketides derived from fatty acylcoa starter molecules but analysis of mutants defective in pollen wall development indicate that other components are also incorporated into sporopollenin also highlighted are the many uncertainties remaining in the development of a sporopolleninfortified pollen wall particularly in relation to the mechanisms of

caspaselike catalytic domains of 20 kda p20 and 10 kda p10 a high conservation was observed in the zinc finger domain type i proteins and in p20 and p10 subunits types i and ii proteins the phylogeny showed that the metacaspases are divided into three principal groups type i with and without zinc finger domain and type ii metacaspases the algae and moss are presented as outgroup suggesting that these three classes of metacaspases originated in the early stages of viridiplantae being the absence of the zinc finger domain the ancient condition the study of metacaspase can clarify their

lignan on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans in spite of a strong antioxidative capacity detected in an in vitro assay no antioxidative effects were detectable in vivo in analogy to this result no modulation of the sensitivity against thermal stress was detectable however incubation with pinoresinol caused an enhanced nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor daf16 insulinigflike

roles in many plant biological processes the dof family transcription factors one of the most important families of transcriptional regulators in higher plants are involved in massive aspects of plant growth development and response to abiotic stresses our study will supply resources for understanding how dof transcription factors respond to abiotic stress and the interaction network of these genes in tolerance mechanism results in this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of dof family factors in chinese cabbage in total 76 genes encoding bradof family transcription factor were identified from chinese cabbage and those bradof factors were divided into nine classes fifteen motifs were found based on dof amino acid sequence alignments chromosome locations and gene duplications of bradof family genes were also analyzed ten duplicate events of bradof genes were discovered in chinese cabbage chromosomes the uneven distribution of bradof genes in brassica chromosomes may cause the expansion of bradof genes in the dof family 37 and 7 orthologous genes were identified between chinese cabbage and arabidopsis and between chinese cabbage and oryza sativa respectively the interaction networks of dof factors in chinese cabbage were also constructed expression profiles of nine selected genes from different nine classes subjected to four abiotic stresses cold heat salt

adapted species under climate change will depend on their ability to migrate apace with their historical climatic envelope or to adapt in place to maintain fitness this second path to persistence can only occur if there is sufficient genetic variance for response to new selection regimes inadequate levels of genetic variation can be remedied through assisted gene flow agf that is the intentional introduction of individuals genetically adapted to localities with historic climates similar to the current or future climate experienced by the resident population however the timing of reproduction is frequently adapted to local conditions phenological mismatch between residents and migrants can reduce resident × migrant mating frequencies slowing the introgression of migrant alleles into the resident genetic background and impeding evolutionary rescue efforts focusing on plants we devised a method to estimate the frequency of resident × migrant matings based on flowering schedules and applied it in an experiment that mimicked the first generation of an agf program with chamaecrista fasciculata a prairie annual under current and expected future temperature regimes phenological

aid the identification of genes underlying phenotypic adaptation across taxa but functional and structural elements of genes can also affect evolutionary rates in plants the edges of exons flanking intron junctions are known to contain splice enhancers and to have a higher degree of conservation compared to the remainder of the coding region however the extent to which these regions may be masking indicators of positive selection or account for the relationship between dnds and other genomic parameters is unclear we investigate the effects of exon edge conservation on the relationship of dnds to various sequence characteristics and gene expression parameters in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana we also obtain lineagespecific dnds estimates making use of the recently sequenced genome of thellungiella parvula the second closest sequenced relative after the sister species arabidopsis lyrata overall we find that the effect of exon edge conservation as well as the use of lineagespecific substitution estimates upon dnds ratios partly explains the relationship between the rates of protein evolution and expression level furthermore the removal of exon edges shifts dnds estimates upwards increasing the proportion of genes potentially under adaptive selection we conclude that lineagespecific substitutions and exon edge conservation have an important effect on dnds

studies of roadside biodiversity methods the proposed systematic map is intended to provide an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides relevant interventions include eg mowing shrub removal control of invasivenuisance species sowing or planting burning grazing by livestock scraping and ditching nonintervention or alternative forms of roadside management will be used as comparators relevant outcomes include measures of species or

situ to assess the effect of social boundaries this study was conducted in the contact zone between the chuka mbeere and tharaka ethnolinguistic groups in eastern kenya sorghum varieties were inventoried and samples collected in 130 households in all 297 individual plants derived from seeds collected under sixteen variety names were characterized using a set of 18 ssr molecular markers and 15 morphological descriptors the genetic structure was investigated using both a bayesian assignment method and distancebased clustering principal coordinates analysis was used to describe the structure of the morphological diversity of the panicles the distribution of the varieties and the main genetic clusters across ethnolinguistic groups was described using a nonparametric manova and pairwise fisher tests the spatial distribution of landrace names and the overall genetic spatial patterns were significantly correlated with ethnolinguistic partition however the genetic structure inferred from molecular makers did not discriminate the shortcycle landraces despite their morphological distinctness the cases of two improved varieties highlighted possible fates of improved materials the most recent one was often given the name of local landraces the second one that was introduced a dozen years ago displays traces of admixture with local landraces with differential

interrogate the role of ll2 and its interaction with the cterminal domain in katg structure and catalysis single and double substitutions of the ll2 apex had little impact on the active site heme by magnetic circular dichroism or electron paramagnetic resonance epr and activity catalase or peroxidase conversely deletion of a single amino acid from the ll2 apex reduced catalase activity by 80

using the easypop model we determined the selfing and migration rates that would match the corresponding genetic structure of microsatellite marker data based on observed and expected heterozygosity parameters the simulated reproductive mode was mixed with a high rate of outcrossing rate  07 this was consistent with a selfingincompatible system in this species which reduced but did not prevent selfing the simulated migration rate was 002 which implied that the forest fragments were isolated by distance and that the inbreeding coefficients were high based on nei’s gene diversity analysis 94 of the genetic variability was distributed within the forest fragments and only 6 of the genetic diversity was caused by differences between them furthermore the minimum viable population and minimum viable area genetic conservation parameters which determine conservation potential in the short and long term suggested that only the inhatinhum forest fragment had the shortterm potential to maintain its genetic diversity however in the long term none of the forest fragments proved to be sustainable indicating that the populations will require intervention to prevent a decline in genetic

environmental parameters  depth and two depthindependent temperature indices  were collected on a 4 m grid across 85 locations throughout the reef we use ordinary kriging to spatially interpolate our environmental data and estimate the three environmental parameters for each colony partial mantel tests indicate a significant correlation between genetic relatedness and depth while controlling for space these results are also supported by multimodel inference furthermore spatial principle component analysis indicates a statistically significant genetic cline along a depth gradient binning the genetic dataset based on sizeclass revealed that the correlation between genetic relatedness and depth was significant for new recruits and increased for larger size classes suggesting a possible role of larval habitat selection as well as selective mortality in structuring intrareef genetic diversity that both preand postrecruitment processes may be involved points to the adaptive role of larval

that plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems understanding the ecophysiology of this plant is fundamental for planning conservation and restoration actions covering this species and its habitat the aim of this study was to explore the acclimation of p oceanica to depth by examining the leaf morphological variation in a depth gradient we measured leaf length width and thickness as well as the distance of fifth and sixth ribs from the margin and the central rib at different depths comparing leaves morphology and histoanatomy leaf length was the only morphological character clearly related to depth whereas the overall morphological variation seems to be due to a change in the histoanatomical characters depthrelated characters showed a different variation pattern from that of not depthrelated ones our results do not fit the model used to explain the seagrass responses to light variation most morphological leaf traits are not directly linked to the acclimation of this species to depth finally we hypothesise that the variation pattern of not depthdependent characters is an expression of p oceanica meadow genetic structure along the depth gradient © 2016 società

the structural and functional organisation of these qtl regions in relation to genome duplication we investigated quantitative resistance to the fungal disease stem canker in brassica napus a highly duplicated amphidiploid species to assess the proportion of resistance qtl located at duplicated positionsresults genomewide association analysis on a panel of 116 oilseed rape varieties genotyped with 3228 snp indicated that 321 markers corresponding to 64 genomic regions are associated with resistance to stem canker these genomic regions are relatively equally distributed on the a 53 and c 47 genomes of b napus overall 44 of these regions 2864 are duplicated homoeologous regions they are located in duplications of six e j r t u and w of the 24 ancestral blocks that constitute the b napus genome overall these six ancestral blocks have 34 duplicated copies in the bnapus genome almost all of the duplicated copies 82 of the 34 regions harboured resistance associated markers for stem canker resistance which suggests structural and functional conservation of genetic factors involved in this trait in b napusconclusions our study provides information on the involvement of duplicated loci in the control of stem canker resistance in b napus further investigation of the similaritydivergence in sequence and gene content of these duplicated regions will provide insight into the conservation and allelic diversity of the underlying genes © 2014 fopa fomeju et al licensee biomed central ltd in plants the last step in the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine gb is the nad dependent oxidation of betaine aldehyde bal catalysed by some aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh 10 enzymes that exhibit betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase badh activity given the irreversibility of the reaction the shortterm regulation of these enzymes is of great physiological relevance to avoid adverse decreases in the nad nadh ratio in the present study we report that the spinacia oleracea badh sobadh is reversibly and partially inactivated by bal in the absence of nad in a time and concentrationdependent mode crystallographic evidence indicates that the nonessential cys450 sobadh numbering forms a thiohemiacetal with bal totally blocking the productive binding of the aldehyde it is of interest that in contrast to cys450  the catalytic cysteine cys291  did not react with bal in the absence of nad  the trimethylammonium group of bal binds in the same position in the inactivating or productive modes accordingly bal does not inactivate the c450 s sobadh mutant and the degree of inactivation of the a441 i and a441 c mutants corresponds to their very different abilities to bind the trimethylammonium group cys450 and the neighbouring residues that participate in stabilizing the thiohemiacetal are strictly conserved in plant aldh10 enzymes with proven or predicted badh activity suggesting that inactivation by bal is their common feature under osmotic stress conditions this novel partial and reversible covalent regulatory mechanism may contribute to preventing nad exhaustion while still permitting the synthesis of high amounts of gb and avoiding the accumulation of the toxic bal © 2016 authors published by portland press limited it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb oncethrough boiler power plant unit in order to meet large

improved to identify the parameters combined with running data after this to further enhance model performance the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of

new crystal structure is the role of an active site loop that closes in upon binding of substratemimicking molecules and which has only been previously reported in a plant enzyme comparison of the available structures indicates that beyond superficial differences alanine aminotransferases of diverse phylogenetic origins share a universal reaction mechanism that depends on an array of highly

pathway of proline synthesis glutamate is phosphorylated to γglutamyl phosphate by γglutamyl kinase reduced to γglutamyl semialdehyde by γglutamyl phosphate reductase cyclized spontaneously to Δ1pyrroline5carboxylate and reduced to proline by Δ1pyrroline5carboxylate reductase in higher plants and animals the first two steps are catalysed by a bifunctional Δ1pyrroline5carboxylate synthase alternative pathways of proline formation use the initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway to ornithine which can be converted to Δ1pyrroline5carboxylate by ornithine aminotransferase and then reduced to proline or converted directly to proline by ornithine cyclodeaminase in some organisms the latter pathways contribute to or could be fully responsible for the synthesis of proline the

polymorphism loci the five extant populations of o littoralis subsp gallaecica showed minimal to none neutral genetic diversity and a lack of gene flow between them moreover genetic structure was identical in samples collected on two consecutive years suggesting that the seed bank cannot buffer against genetic loss high rates of selffertilization together with a strongly fragmented distribution and recurrent bottlenecks seem the likely mechanisms that may have led to a dramatic loss of genetic variation in a classic scenario drawn by genetic drift despite the extremely narrow distribution range reciprocal transplant experiments revealed that the populations differed in several quantitative traits and that these differences likely have a genetic basis nevertheless the pattern of differences among populations did not fit the expectations of local adaptation instead phenotypic variation seemed another outcome of genetic drift with important implications for conservation because each population should be designated as an independent evolutionary significant unit esu our study evidences the benefits of combining neutral markers with appropriate assessments

paralogues and a first analysis of allelic diversity we discuss possibilities to further study the roles of these paralogues in lignin biosynthesis including expression analysis reverse genetics and forward genetics such as association mapping we propose criteria to prioritise paralogues within multigene families and certain snps within these genes for developing genotyping assays or increasing

protocol for storage of alder clones the technique described is useful for in vitro germplasm collections decreasing the risk of genetic changes and associated costs the aim of this study was to develop a simple method for the mediumterm storage of alnus glutinosa l gaertn explants obtained from trees aged 20–30 years several parameters were evaluated including type of explant shoot apex or nodal segments prestorage treatment 0 or 10 days after the last subculture and duration of cold storage 3–24 months at 2–4 °c explants were maintained at this temperature under dim lighting on woody plant medium supplemented with 01 mg l−1 6benzyladenine and 05 mg l−1 indole3acetic acid under these conditions a high percentage 75–87  of cultures remained viable after 18 months in cold cabinets the stored material was successfully recovered and multiplied normally in the same medium showing good growth and developing into normal shoots that were morphologically similar to those of nonstored controls at the histological level the main change observed was the accumulation of starch granules in cells of the shoot apex as well as in cells located close to the vascular bundles after 3 months of cold storage as the duration of cold storage increased the number and size of the starch granules decreased but cell plasmolysis and the content of lipid droplets increased cold damage was generalized after 24 months at 4 °c this study provides new insights into the changes occurring in a glutinosa during cold storage © 2014 springerverlag berlin heidelberg the facilitates chromatin

domain of spt16 subunit spt16n is strictly conserved in all the known spt16 orthologs genetic studies in yeast have revealed a partially redundant role of spt16n for the fact functionality here we report the crystal structure of spt16n from a plant origin spt16nca cicer arietinum and its comparisons with the known spt16n structures from yeasts and human the interdomain angle in spt16nca is significantly different from that of the yeast and human spt16n structures normal mode analysis and classical molecular dynamics simulations reveal interdomain movement in spt16nca and later also shows conformational flexibility of the critical loops spt16nca binds to histone h3h4 complex similar to its orthologs from yeast and human origins further conservation of electrostatic surface

primers were developed in the perennial herbs of the diploidpolyploid complex veronica subsect pentasepalae plantaginaceae to investigate the role that hybridization has played in the evolution of the group which includes several endangered species methods and results twelve pairs of primers leading to polymorphic and readable markers were identified and optimized from v jacquinii and v orbiculata using a microsatelliteenriched library method and 454 gsflx technique the set of primers amplified dinucleotide to pentanucleotide repeats and the number of alleles per locus ranged from one to six one to 11 and one to nine for v orsiniana v javalambrensis and v rosea respectively transferability analyses were performed in 20 species corresponding to 10 different subgenera conclusions these results indicate the utility of the newly developed microsatellites across veronica subsect pentasepalae which will help in the study of gene flow patterns and genetic structure © 2015 lópezgonzález et al published by the botanical society of america in this study the genetic constitution of wild grape populations distributed in the zagros mountains in the northwest part of iran was investigated to assess their risk of extinction and to identify the most suitable conservation strategy a total of 65 wild grapevine samples from five different populations were analysed using 23 ssr loci consistent allelic richness was detected in all the analysed populations from 401 to 535 the observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were high with mean values of 067 and 069 respectively a modest heterozygosity deficiency was detected only in the piranshahr and sardashtshalmash populations the neighbourjoining dendrogram clustered the accessions into three groups corresponding to the geographical distribution of the populations molecular data combined with field evaluation revealed that an ex situ conservation approach is the most suitable strategy for preserving the genetic richness of iranian wild grape populations with consistent rare alleles about 20 we propose in situ preservation only in the case of the sardashtghasmarash population to ensure that evolutionary dynamic forces continue to influence plant adaptation and survival in response to environmental alterations © niab 2014 aim maintaining genetic diversity and evolutionary processes are important goals in plant conservation genetic studies are increasingly undertaken but results from such studies are still rarely implemented as management actions in the field we address this ‘researchimplementation gap’ by developing a plainlanguage genetic assessment approach for populationlevel conservation prioritization based on measurement of key genetic parameters our aim was to improve understanding between conservation researchers and practitioners enabling practitioners to incorporate genetic information into conservation actions and conservation genetic researchers to address research explicitly resulting in conservation action location applicable globally methods we derived a decisionmaking framework that identifies appropriate management strategies for threatened populations based on the level of genetic differentiation fst genetic diversity expected heterozygosity he and inbreeding fis characterized as ‘high’ or ‘low’ in comparison with a reference benchmark we demonstrate the application of the framework in two case studies of threatened plants and more broadly from the literature results applying the decision framework we found that for prostanthera eurybioides the population of conservation concern does not currently require specialized genetic management and mitigation of ecological threats should be prioritized instead for allocasuarina robusta we found connectivity was high and strategies should be put in place to maintain gene flow in both cases genetic information was important for designing restocking strategies accounting for the genetic structure and genetic diversity of source and recipient populations from the literature key examples of species types that fit each of the genetic management scenarios are given main conclusions we find that the application of our simplified genetic assessment framework helps to clarify management actions based on conservation genetic information for threatened flora and should assist in bridging the gap between researchers and conservation practitioners for integrated conservation outcomes our framework could equally apply to fauna conservation with appropriate consideration of animalspecific management issues © 2015 john wiley  sons ltd orchids are one of the promising medicinal plant families of which dendrobium crepidatum lindl  paxton figures out

2016 elsevier gmbh we used allozyme electrophoresis to survey genetic diversity of agrostis barceloi lsáez  rosselló an extremely narrow endemic species from the island of majorca balearic islands western mediterranean basin this species is a tetraploid with a single natural population of less than 100 individuals all analyzed individuals of a barceloi showed the same genotype four out of 18 interpretable loci showed fixed heterozygosity thus supporting an allopolyploid origin the genotypic uniformity of this species may be attributed to a founder effect associated with a dispersal event of its ancestor from the continent a very small current effective population size ne and a series of natural or anthropogenic threats affecting the population we propose several conservation measures such as seed storing and plant production for further reinforcements which do not need any previous work for selecting individuals because of the genetic uniformity in addition we suggest the preservation of the mountain summit where the species is found puig major which would also positively influence the conservation of other cooccurring enes and other rare and threatened species ©

citrus species epitomizes the positive selection pressures exerted on advantageous genes in such pathogens a deeper insight into the evolution of these lipasesesterases is essential to develop resistance mechanisms in transgenic plants directed evolution an attempt to accelerate the evolutionary steps in the laboratory is inherently simple when targeted for loss of function a bigger challenge is to specify mutations that endow a new function such as a lost functionality in a duplicated gene previously we have proposed a method for enumerating candidates for mutations intended to transfer the functionality of one protein into another related protein based on the spatial and electrostatic properties of the active site residues decaaf in the current work we present in vivo validation of decaaf by inducing tributyrin hydrolysis in lesb based on the active site similarity to lesa the structures of these proteins have been modeled using raptorx based on the closely related lipa protein from xanthomonas oryzae these mutations replicate the spatial and electrostatic conformation of lesa in the modeled structure of the mutant lesb as well providing in silico validation

the positive aspects of hybrids and hybridization specific implications of natural genetic introgression are addressed with a few examples from butterflies including transgressive phenotypes and climatedriven homoploid recombinant hybrid speciation some specific examples illustrate these points using the swallowtail butterflies papilionidae with their longterm historical data base

opportunity for genetic reassortment through recombination experimental data indicates that relative to their wild ancestors cultivated sunflower varieties show a higher recombination rate during meiosis to better understand the molecular basis for this difference we compared gene expression in male sunflower meiocytes in prophase i isolated from a domesticated line a wild relative and a f1 hybrid of the two results of the genes that showed differential expression between the wild and domesticated genotypes 6362  could not be identified as proteincoding genes and of these genes 7098  passed stringent filters to be classified as long noncoding rnas lncrnas compared to the sunflower somatic transcriptome meiocytes express a higher proportion of lncrnas and the majority of genes with exclusive expression in meiocytes were lncrnas around 40  of the lncrnas showed sequence similarity with small rnas srna while 153  were predicted to be sunflower natural antisense transcripts nats and 918  contained transposable elements te we identified 6895 lncrnas that are exclusively expressed in meiocytes these lncrnas appear to have higher conservation a greater degree of differential expression a higher proportion of srna similarity and higher te content relative to lncrnas that are also expressed in the somatic transcriptome conclusions lncrnas play important roles in plant meiosis and may participate in chromatin modification processes although other regulatory functions cannot be excluded lncrnas could also be related to the different recombination rates seen for

demographic history and useful information for their conservation therefore we conducted population genomic analyses of 88 nuclear genes to explore the population dynamics of a mangrove tree lumnitzera racemosa across the indowest pacific region our results revealed pronounced genetic differentiation in this species between the populations from the indian ocean and the pacific ocean which may be attributable to the longterm isolation between the western and eastern coasts of the malay peninsula during sealevel drops in the pleistocene glacial periods the mixing of haplotypes from the two highly divergent groups was0 identified in a cambodian population at almost all 88 nuclear genes suggesting genetic admixture of the two lineages at the boundary region similar genetic admixture was also found in other populations from southeast asia based on the bayesian clustering analysis of six nuclear genes which suggests extensive and recent secondary contact of the two divergent lineages in southeast asia computer simulations indicated substantial migration from the indian ocean towards the south china sea which likely results in the genetic admixture in southeast asia the terpene compounds represent the largest and most diverse class of plant secondary metabolites which are important in plant growth and development the 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase hmgr ec 11134 is one of the key enzymes contributed to terpene biosynthesis to better understand the basic characteristics and evolutionary history of the hmgr gene family in plants a genomewide analysis of hmgr genes from 20 representative species was carried out a total of 56 hmgr genes in the 14 land plant genomes were identified but no genes were found in all 6 algal genomes the gene structure and protein architecture of all plant hmgr genes were highly conserved the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the plant hmgrs were derived from one ancestor gene and finally developed into four distinct groups two in the monocot plants and two in dicot plants speciesspecific gene duplications caused mainly by segmental duplication led to the limited expansion of hmgr genes in zea mays gossypium raimondii populus trichocarpa and glycine max after the species diverged the analysis of kaks ratios and expression profiles indicated that functional divergence after the gene duplications was restricted the results suggested that the function and evolution of hmgr gene family were dramatically conserved throughout the plant kingdom © 2014 li et al wrky proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors and play important regulatory roles in plant development and defense response the wrky gene family in salvia miltiorrhiza has not been characterized results a total of 61smwrkys

largely conserved with arabidopsis atwrkys each group of wrky domains contains characteristic conserved sequences and groupspecific motifs might attribute to functional divergence of wrkys a total of 17 pairs of orthologous smwrky and atwrky genes and 21 pairs of paralogous smwrky genes were identified maximum likelihood analysis showed that smwrkys had undergone strong selective pressure for adaptive evolution functional divergence analysis suggested that the smwrky subgroup genes and many paralogous smwrky gene pairs were divergent in functions various critical amino acids contributed to functional divergence among subgroups were detected of the 61smwrkys 22 13 4 and 1 were predominantly expressed in roots stems leaves and flowers respectively the other 21 were mainly expressed in at least two tissues analyzed in s miltiorrhiza roots treated with meja significant changes of gene expression were observed for 49 smwrkys of which 26 were upregulated 18 were downregulated while the other 5 were either upregulated or downregulated at different timepoints of treatment analysis of published rnaseq data showed that 42 of the 61 identified smwrkys were yeast extract and agresponsive through a systematic analysis smwrkys potentially involved in tanshinone biosynthesis were predicted conclusion these results provide insights into functional conservation and diversification of smwrkys and are useful information for further elucidating smwrky functions © li et al sauvagesia rhodoleuca is one of the most endangered species in china it has a narrow distribution in the

inbreeding coefficients fis within populations were high suggests the probable selfing in the speciescombination of the upgma dendrogram and the instruct analysis show that six extant populations could be classified into three distinct genetic groups and no pattern of isolation by distance was detected among populations the low genetic variation within populations and high genetic

consensus map was developed that combined data from two mapping populations and integrated recombination data from both parents of this largely obligate outcrossing species the consensus map consisted of 1321 loci and spanned 2122 cm an analysis of the distribution of genic and genomic markers across the length of a linkage group showed that genic markers were relatively overrepresented in distal regions while genomic markers were relatively overrepresented in pericentromeric regions furthermore genic markers located in distal and pericentromeric regions identified orthologs in the genome of the closely related species foxtail millet setaria italica l p beauv at a similar rate but fewer orthologs were found for genomic markers that mapped to pericentromeric regions compared to distal regions because crossspecies sequence conservation is largely limited to genes our data suggest that genomic markers that map to distal regions are more likely to be derived from genic regions than those that map to pericentromeric regions a comparative analysis between loci on the switchgrass consensus map and their orthologs in the foxtail millet genome showed that the two species varied by at least nine inversions and one reciprocal translocation extending the comparative analysis to sorghum demonstrated that the majority of the rearrangements occurred in the foxtail millet genome in the past 13 million years the reduction in chromosome number from 10 in the andropogoneae to 9 in the paniceae was achieved through a complex set of rearrangements involving three ancestral chromosomes orthologous to sorghum chromosomes 6 8 and 9 and chromosomes iii and vii in the lineage leading to switchgrass and foxtail millet upon insertion of ancestral chromosome 9 into ancestral chromosome 8

encapsulationdehydration encapsulationvitrification and dropletvitrification vitrification involves the application of cryoprotectant solutions that increase cell viscosity to a critical point at which water forms a metastable glass on exposure to ultra low temperatures while ncapsulationdehydration involves removing cell water through osmotic and evaporative dehydration to achieve the same

issrs markers were used to analyze polymorphism in a liliifolia genome and to evaluate the genetic diversity and accordingly the state of a recently identified population five issr primers specially designed for plants and containing different simple sequence repeat motifs were tested a total of 52 issr fragments were generated of which 41 were polymorphic 7884 and 32 6153 specific to adenophora genus the value of shannon’s index of genotypic diversity was 0812 jaccard similarity coefficient was calculated for pair wise comparisons among all individuals and ranged from 017 to 083 the genetic variability between individuals was 7884 which suggests a relative high genetic differentiation although the level of genetic variability is moderate to high the population is declining and exposed to

mechanisms that generate de novo variation may result in considerable intracultivar variation in the long term cultivars adopted and widely grown by farmers may lose their identity and healthiness nevertheless longevity of elite cultivars is of paramount importance due to timeconsuming and costly endeavors to breed them therefore an appropriate continuous intracultivar selection might be necessary to treat the breeder seed in a sustainable manner an ultraspaced nursery to exclude planttoplant interference for resources nil competition constitutes ideal conditions for two reasons nil competition boosts the phenotypic expression of genetic differences so as to make selection applicable within a narrow gene pool it also erases the masking effects in recognition of the desirable genotypes induced by the negative relationship between yielding and competitive ability relevant investigations into several crops have encouraged intense selection at nil competition as a useful technique either to upgrade or to avoid gradual degradation of the genetic background to maintain uniformity and secure optimal quality of breeder seed over longer periods of time a conservation breeding strategy is presented comprising a periodical selection round to secure breeder seed devoid of harmful alterations and consecutive selection rounds to produce prebasic seed of high quality

but only 10 mature micrornas are present in mirbase version 21 the most used mirna database and no phasirnas have been identified for the model legume phaseolus vulgaris thanks to the recent availability of the first version of the common bean genome degradome data and small rna libraries we are able to present here a catalog of the micrornas and phasirnas for this organism and particularly we suggest new protagonists in the symbiotic nodulation events results we identified a set of 185 mature mirnas including 121 previously unpublished sequences encoded by 307 precursors and distributed in 98 families degradome data allowed us to identify a total of 181 targets for these mirnas we reveal two regulatory networks involving conserved mirnas those known to play crucial roles in the establishment of nodules and novel mirnas present only in common bean suggesting a specific role for these sequences in addition we identified 125 loci that potentially produce phased small rnas with 47 of them having all the characteristics of being triggered by a total of 31 mirnas including 14 new mirnas identified in this study conclusions we provide here a set of new small rnas that contribute to the broader knowledge of the srnaome of phaseolus vulgaris thanks to the identification of the mirna targets from degradome analysis and the construction of regulatory networks

of the study was to assess the genetic diversity present in south african sorghum genotypes using genetic distances as measured by simple sequence repeat ssr markers in total 103 diverse landraces and breeding lines were genotyped using 30 ssr primers a wide genetic diversity was observed with the allele sizes ranging from 90 to 294 bp the numbers of alleles ranged from 2 to 15 with an average of 64 per locus the polymorphic information content ranged from 00192 to 08351 average 05031 with heterozygosity values of 00194 to 08524 average 05483 the euclidian genetic distances varied from 0 to 84 average 57 genotypes maciasa and as4 had the lowest dissimilarity index whereas 05potch115 and mp2048 exhibited the highest value the study established the existence of considerable genetic diversity

on the container area of leibniz university of hannover plants were treated with temperatures of 12°c and 6°c under controlled conditions relative electrolyte leakage as a measure of damage due to frost increased with decreasing temperatures and sprouting stage glucose fructose sucrose gfs and starch declined with sprouting while proline increased starch and proline did not react to late frost treatment while gfs were variable between treatments years and time of the year populations differed consistently only in their proline concentrations sprouting stage was the most significant factor influencing both frostinduced electrolyte leakage and biomarkers in conclusion there were no clear consistent differences between the tested populations in spite of varied climatic conditions and geographical distance between their places of origin hence no late frost consequences in populations’ transfer with regards to latitude and altitude will be expected within the range investigated here

populations of e velutina with a focus on the selection of tree seeds a total of 108 individuals from five natural populations and one restored population were analyzed using issr markers resulting in 407 polymorphic fragments a high rate of polymorphism was observed in the restored population the highest genetic variability was identified within populations 82 genetic bottleneck tests were

the restored population retained unique alleles similarly increased genetic distance was observed in individuals of the restored populations compared to the other populations observed genetic variation in both natural and restored populations of e velutina was moderate thus enabling selection of divergent trees from those trees supplying seeds environmental protection and management of these areas is necessary for the maintenance of these individuals and subsequent reproduction we recommend suggestions for e velutina conservation since the restoration model adopted in this study did

progenitor of cultivated soybean glycine max l merr is widely distributed in the sinojapanese floristic region sjfr therefore it is an excellent model organism to study the effect of quaternary climatic changes on the distribution and migration of plant taxa in the sjfr to investigate the phylogeography of g soja a total of 632 individuals representing 52 populations throughout the species distribution range were genotyped by using the sequencing data of a nuclear locus af105221 and a chloroplast locus trnqrps16 we detected a total of 23 haplotypes from two loci including five common and 18 rare haplotypes among them 17 rare haplotypes were limited to northeast asia northeast china nec and korea and the yangzi river basin middle and downstream of the yangzi river mdyr and the eastern end of southwest china swc moreover two common haplotypes were detected throughout the species distribution wide range all the haplotypes from japan and the korean peninsula were also found in china the haplotype distribution patterns of the two loci suggested that northeast asia nec and korea and the yangzi river basin mdyr and the eastern end of swc might have been the refugia for g soja

arid lands by providing highly nutritious fruit while surviving extreme heat and environmental conditions despite its importance from antiquity few genetic resources are available for improving the productivity and development of the dioecious date palm to date there has been no genetic map and no sex chromosome has been identifiedresults here we present the first genetic map for date palm and identify the putative date palm sex chromosome we placed 4000 markers on the map using nearly 1200 framework markers spanning a total of 1293 cm we have integrated the genetic map derived from the khalas cultivar with the draft genome and placed up to 19 of the draft genome sequence scaffolds onto linkage groups for the first time this analysis revealed approximately 19 cmmb on the map

foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment limits of concern loc methods we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment we then considered its relationship with protection goals the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing longterm effects effects on nontarget organisms and species of conservation concern results the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm however the concept leaves many important aspects open thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept locs for longterm effects have to be evaluated by longterm monitoring locs for nontarget organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed conclusions the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated although locs will finally be determined by political decisions they should be based on

against animal including human and plant pathogenic fungi and its role in fungalmediated wood degradation genomewide analysis of fungal species revealed the presence of cyp53 members in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes basidiomycetes had a higher number of cyp53 members in their genomes than ascomycetes only two cyp53 subfamilies were found in ascomycetes and six subfamilies in basidiomycetes suggesting that during the divergence of phyla ascomycetes lost cyp53 p450s according to phylogenetic and genestructure analysis enrichment of cyp53 p450s in basidiomycetes occurred due to the extensive duplication of cyp53 p450s in their genomes numerous amino acids 103 were found to be conserved in the ascomycetes cyp53 p450s against only seven in basidiomycetes cyp53 p450s 3dmodelling and activesite cavity mapping data revealed that the ascomycetes cyp53 p450s have a highly conserved protein structure whereby 78 amino acids in the activesite cavity were found to be conserved because of this rigid nature of ascomycetes cyp53 p450s active site cavity any inhibitor directed against this p450 family can serve as a common antifungal drug target particularly toward pathogenic ascomycetes the dynamic nature of basidiomycetes cyp53 p450s at a gene and protein level indicates that these p450s are destined to acquire novel functions functional analysis of cyp53 p450s strongly supported our hypothesis that the ascomycetes cyp53 p450s ability is limited for detoxification of toxic molecules whereas basidiomycetes cyp53 p450s play an additional role ie involvement in

conservation act six regions of origin have been designated according to ecogeographical parameters as little is known about the actual genetic situation of most species affected by the new law we investigate the genetic diversity differentiation of autochthonous sloe populations across germany and discuss our findings with respect to conservation law and its practical implication methods – fifteen autochthonous populations of sloe from all officially designated regions of origin were analysed using a highly reproducible highannealingtemperature hat rapd protocol genetic differentiation was assessed using distance based and bayesian approaches key results – general heterozygosity detected within the populations was in the same range as described for other woody species he 0171–0213 while the observed values of genetic differentiation between populations varied considerably fst0025–0226 the majority was found in the moderate range only two moderately differentiated genetic clusters were identified for sloe in germany conclusions – moderate genetic differentiation was observed between the two main clusters of sloe populations in germany here no strong evidence was found for isolation by distance ibd or by adaption iba the genetic constitution of sloe populations across germany rather seems to support isolation by colonialization ibc as the main driver of the moderate genetic differentiation in this species the observed genetic differentiation and the geographic location of the identified genetic clusters only partially coincide with the designated regions of origin defined by german authorities for the implementation of the nature conservation act in our opinion those regions can only be considered a first step in the preservation of genetic diversity upon availability of data on genetic structure and differentiation in a given species the regions of origin should gradually be adapted to reflect those structures for each analysed species © 2016

to investigate hybridization between woody perennials although geographically widespread the introduction over the past two centuries has been limited to a few elite clonal cultivars providing a unique opportunity to study the effects of hybridization on the native species the amount of hybridization with v vinifera and the genetic diversity of wildgrowing vitis californica and vitis girdiana

used to identify which v vinifera cultivars served as parents of f1 hybrids the three species were clearly distinguished by structure analysis thirty percent of 119 v californica vines were hybrids the domesticated parent was identified for 16 f1 hybrid vines the original california cultivar mission was the parent of eight backcrosses were also found showing introgression into subsequent generations similar results were obtained for a small sample of v girdiana removing hybrids greatly reduced the genetic variation of the presumed pure species among which there was essentially no

premise of research in the future ecosystems will have to deal with climate warming in combination with increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as drought adaptive phenotypic plasticity enables plants to respond to environmental variability and is likely to buffer impacts of climate change therefore factors that influence the phenotypic plasticity of plant populations must be identified to assess climate change outcomes and support conservation measures genetic diversity in many temperate plant species is known to vary among regions and populations largely as a result of their phylogeographic history during the late pleistocene and holocene here we argue that high neutral genetic diversity of populations might represent increased probability of possessing alleles or allele combinations that are advantageous or more capable in terms of average response capacities to environmental change methodology we test this idea for european beech fagus sylvatica by investigating response patterns of plant growth and leaf phenology to drought and warming treatments in a commongarden experiment with seedlings of six populations from bulgaria and germany phenotypic plasticity of populations was assessed and correlated with allozyme diversity populations differed in their plasticity to warming with respect to timing of leaf unfolding and senescence as well as in their drought plasticity in terms of height increment marginally not significant with some populations showing consistently high plasticity among traits pivotal results measures of genetic diversity showed an interregional structure according to known phylogeographic patterns height increment plasticity showed a significant positive correlation with genetic variation allelic diversity at the population level conclusions our results suggest general differences in phenotypic plasticity among populations and a potential influence of genetic diversity on the average plasticity besides its evolutionary value genetic diversity might thus be an important property of plant populations for their shortterm response capability against adverse effects of climate change © 2015 by the university

no canonical gα instead a single gene encoding an extralarge gα xlg protein exists in the p patens genome here we demonstrate that in p patens the canonical gα is biochemically and functionally replaced by an xlg protein which works in the same genetic pathway as one of the gβ proteins to control its development furthermore the specific gprotein subunits in p patens are essential for its

tightly clustered spatially and were likely produced either by belowground flowers or by aboveground flowers with limited seed dispersal other selfedinbred individuals were spatially separated maximum of 15 m and were likely produced by aboveground flowers followed by seed dispersal by ants finescale patterns of genetic structure indicate that some gene flow is occurring among aboveground ch flowers but both pollen and outcrossed seeds are moving limited distances maximum of 05 km because genetic variation is structured at a fine spatial scale protecting many populations is necessary to

work was to study the effect of 6benzylaminopurine ba on petal senescence by transcript profile comparison after 3 or 6 h using a crossspecies method by hybridizing petunia samples to a 4 × 44 k agilent tomato array the relative content of ethylene abscisic acid anthocyanins total carotenoids and total phenols that determine the physiological behaviours of the petal tissue were measured ba treatment prolonged the flower life and increased the concentrations of phenols and anthocyanins while total carotenoids did not increase and were lower than the control the ethylene biosynthetic and perception gene expressions were studied immediately after treatment until 24 h and all genes were repressed while ethylene production was strongly induced after 4 days the microarray analyses highlighted that ba strongly affected gene regulation after 3 h but only 14 of genes remained differentially expressed after 6 h the most affected pathways and genes were those related to stress such as heat shock proteins abscisic acid aba catabolism and its signalling pathway lipid metabolism and antioxidant defence systems a gene annotation enrichment analysis using david showed that the most

their population dynamics the monarch butterfly is an iconic species whose continental migratory population in eastern north america has been declining precipitously recent analyses have linked the monarch decline to reduced abundance of milkweed host plants in the usa caused by increased use of genetically modified herbicideresistant crops to identify the most sensitive stages in the monarchs annual multigenerational migration and to test the milkweed limitation hypothesis we analyzed 22 years of citizen science records from four monitoring programs across north america we analyzed the relationships between butterfly population indices at successive stages of the annual migratory cycle to assess demographic connections and to address the roles of migrant population size versus temporal trends that reflect changes in habitat or resource quality we find a sharp annual population decline in the first breeding generation in the southern usa driven by the progressively smaller numbers of spring migrants from the overwintering grounds in mexico monarch populations then build regionally during the summer generations contrary to the milkweed limitation hypothesis we did not find statistically significant temporal trends in stagetostage population relationships in the midwestern or northeastern usa in contrast there are statistically significant negative temporal trends at the overwintering grounds in mexico suggesting that monarch success during the fall migration and reestablishment strongly contributes to the butterfly decline lack of milkweed the only host plant for monarch butterfly caterpillars is unlikely to be driving the monarchs population decline conservation efforts therefore require additional focus on the later phases in the monarchs annual

2014 elsevier bv hundreds of experiments have now manipulated species richness sr of various groups of organisms and examined how this aspect of biological diversity influences ecosystem functioning ecologists have recently expanded this field to look at whether phylogenetic diversity pd among species often quantified as the sum of branch lengths on a molecular phylogeny leading to all species in a community also predicts ecological function some have hypothesized that phylogenetic divergence should be a superior predictor of ecological function than sr because evolutionary relatedness represents the degree of ecological and functional differentiation among species but studies to date have provided mixed support for this hypothesis here we reanalyse data from 16 experiments that have manipulated plant sr in grassland ecosystems and examined the impact on aboveground biomass production over multiple time points using a new molecular phylogeny of the plant species used in these experiments we quantified how the pd of plants impacts average community biomass production as well as the stability of community biomass production through time using four complementary analyses we show that after statistically controlling for variation in sr pd the sum of branches in a molecular phylogenetic tree connecting all species in a community is neither related to mean community biomass nor to the temporal stability of biomass these results run counter to past claims however after controlling for sr pd was positively related to variation in community biomass over time due to an increase in the variances of individual species but this relationship was not strong enough to influence community stability in contrast to the nonsignificant relationships between pd biomass and stability our analyses show that sr per se tends to increase the mean biomass production of plant communities after controlling for pd the relationship between sr and temporal variation in community biomass was either positive nonsignificant or negative depending on which analysis was used however the increases in community biomass with sr independently of pd always led to increased stability these results suggest that pd is no better as a predictor of ecosystem functioning than sr synthesis our study on grasslands offers a cautionary tale when trying to relate pd to ecosystem functioning suggesting that there may be ecologically important trait and functional variation among species that is not explained by phylogenetic relatedness our results fail to support the hypothesis that the conservation of evolutionarily distinct species would be more effective than the conservation of sr as a way to maintain productive and stable communities under changing environmental conditions 2015

tolerance however the molecular mechanisms of the stressrelated trehalose pathway and the role of individual trehalose biosynthetic enzymes for stress tolerance remain unclear results trehalose6phosphate phosphatase tpp catalyzes the final step of trehalose metabolism investigating the subcellular localization of the arabidopsis thaliana tpp family members we identified attppd as a chloroplastlocalized enzyme plants deficient in attppd were hypersensitive whereas plants overexpressing attppd were more tolerant to high salinity stress elevated stress tolerance of attppd overexpressors correlated with high starch levels and increased accumulation of soluble sugars suggesting a role for attppd in regulating sugar metabolism under salinity conditions biochemical analyses indicate that attppd is a target of posttranslational redox regulation and can be reversibly inactivated by oxidizing conditions two cysteine residues were identified as the redoxsensitive sites structural and mutation analyses suggest that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge regulates attppd activity innovation the activity of different attpp isoforms located in the cytosol nucleus and chloroplasts can be redox regulated suggesting that the trehalose metabolism might relay the redox status of different cellular compartments to regulate diverse biological processes such as stress responses conclusion the evolutionary conservation of the two redox regulatory cysteine residues of tpps in spermatophytes indicates that redox regulation of tpps might be a

channels are the prominent members of the mip superfamily experimental studies show that mips are involved in important physiological processes in mammals and plants they are implicated in several human diseases and are considered to be attractive drug targets for a wide range of diseases such as cancer brain edema epilepsy glaucoma and congestive heart failure threedimensional structures of mip channels from diverse sources reveal that mips adopt a unique conserved hourglass helical fold consisting of six transmembrane helices tm1tm6 and two halfhelices lb and le conserved npa motifs near the center and the aromaticarginine selectivity filter arr sf toward the extracellular side constitute two narrow constriction regions within the channel structural knowledge combined with simulation studies have helped to investigate the role of these two constriction regions in the transport and selectivity of the solutes with the availability of many genome sequences from diverse species a large number of mip genes have been identified homology models of 1500 mip channels have been used to derive structurebased sequence alignment of tm1tm6 helices and the two halfhelices lb and le thirteen residues are highly conserved in different transmembrane helices and halfhelices high group conservation of small and weakly polar residues is observed in 27 positions at the interface of two interacting helices thus although the mip sequences are diverse the hourglass helical fold is maintained during evolution with the conservation of these 40 positions within the transmembrane region we have proposed a generic structurebased numbering scheme for the mip channels that will facilitate easier comparison of the mip sequences analysis of arr sf in all 1500 mips indicates the extent of diversity in the four residues that form this narrow region certain residues are completely avoided in the sf even if they have the same chemical nature as that of the most frequently observed residues for example arginine is the most preferred residue in a specific position of arr sf whereas lysine is almost always avoided in any of the four positions mip channels with highly hydrophobic or hydrophilic arr sf have been identified similarly there are examples of mip channels in which all four residues of arr sf are bulky thus almost occluding the pore many plant mips possess small residues at all sf positions resulting in a larger pore diameter a majority of mip channels are yet to be functionally characterized and their in vivo substrates are not yet identified a complete understanding of the relationship between the nature of arr sf and the solutes that are transported is required to exploit mip channels as potential drug targets © 2015 elsevier inc all

temporal acute versus sub chronic as well as seasonal differences in innate immunity of fish exposed to reuse water were observed the acute exposure of fish to reuse water caused significant downregulation in cytokine gene expression in different organs of fish kidney spleen liver and phagocytic ability of different kidney leukocyte subpopulations the immune gene expression and phagocytosis of kidney leukocytes of fish returned to act control levels after sub chronic exposure suggesting that fish have habituated to the reuse water exposure the changes in gene expression after acute exposure were related to variations in the profile of xenobiotics in reuse water during different seasons the efficiency of xenobiotic removal using uvh2o2 ranged between 16 and 100 indicating that treatment of reuse water using high dose uvh2o2 was only partially effective in removing the xenobiotics as assessed by both chemical analyses and measurement of innate immune responsiveness of the fish furthermore exposure of fish to reuse water and uvh2o2treated reuse water generated in the spring and fall caused greater changes in innate immunity after acute exposure

density whereas genetic variation decreased with population density in contrast to our assumptions we observed denser populations and cushions in the region with the higher magnitude of isolation whereas reproductive traits and genetic variation within populations were comparable in both regions this corroborates the assumption that stronger isolation must not necessarily result in the loss of

genomics for the experts working for the conservation of endangered plant and animal species © 2016 suliman khan et al background the european continent is presently colonized by nine species of the genus pulsatilla five of which are encountered only in mountainous regions of southwest and southcentral europe the remaining four species inhabit lowlands in the northcentral and eastern parts of the continent most plants of the genus pulsatilla are rare and endangered which is why most research efforts focused on their biology ecology and hybridization the objective of this study was to develop genomic resources including complete plastid genomes and nuclear rrna clusters for three sympatric pulsatilla species that are most commonly found in central europe the results will supply valuable information about genetic variation which can be used in the process of designing primers for population studies and conservation genetics research the complete plastid genomes together with the nuclear rrna cluster can serve as a useful tool in hybridization studies methodologyprincipal findings six complete plastid genomes and nuclear rrna clusters were sequenced from three species of pulsatilla using the illumina sequencing technology four junctions between single copy regions and inverted repeats and junctions between the identified locallycollinear blocks lcb were confirmed by sanger sequencing pulsatilla genomes of 120 unique genes had a total length of approximately 161–162 kb and 21 were duplicated in the inverted repeats ir region comparative plastid genomes of newlysequenced pulsatilla and the previouslyidentified plastomes of aconitum and ranunculus species belonging to the family ranunculaceae revealed several variations in the structure of the genome but the gene content remained constant the nuclear rrna cluster 18sits158sits226s of studied pulsatilla species is 5795 bp long among five analyzed regions of the rrna cluster only internal transcribed spacer 2 its2 enabled the molecular delimitation of closelyrelated pulsatilla patens and pulsatilla vernalis conclusionssignificance the determination of complete plastid genome and nuclear rrna cluster sequences in three species of the genus pulsatilla is an important contribution to our knowledge of the evolution and phylogeography of those endangered taxa the resulting data can be used to identify regions that are particularly useful for barcoding phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies the investigated taxa can be identified at each stage of development based on their speciesspecific snps the nuclear and plastid genomic resources enable advanced studies on hybridization including identification of parent species including their roles in that process the identified nonsynonymous mutations could play an important role in adaptations to changing environments the results of the study will also provide valuable information about the evolution of the plastome structure in the family ranunculaceae © 2015 by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland common beech fagus sylvatica l is the most important species of forest trees in bosnia and herzegovina this research provides the results of investigation into the phenological variability of 22 common beech provenances in the international trial near kakanj bosnia and herzegovina both for the properties of autumn coloration and winter leaf retention the experiment included eight provenances from bosnia and herzegovina four from germany three from serbia two from croatia romania and switzerland each and one from hungary the experiment was established in a randomized block system with three repetitions the goal of this research was to establish whether there were differences in variability between the investigated provenances and what features would be important for future management and regeneration of beech forests as well as for increased production and adaptability based on the investigated phenological properties statistically significant variability was found between all the studied provenances the established differences included the beginning duration and end of particular phenophases there are considerable statistically significant differences in flushing among the studied provenances provenances from croatia and bosnia and herzegovina flush earlier than foreign provenances april the 10th can be considered as the beginning of common beech vegetation in this international trial because this is the date on which bud opening occurred in twelve out of 22 provenances the analysis of leaf colour of different common beech provenances revealed variations in the presence of different groups of colours with varying shades in a particular period current differences in winter leaf retention indicate that 6592  of the plants in the entire experiment do not retain the leaves the highest proportion of leaf nonretention amounting to 9105  was manifested by the provenance from germany hoellerbach it can be concluded that common beech is genetically differentiated according to ecological and vegetation areas and that it shows different morphological and physiological characteristics from different provenance areas this proves that morphological and physiological properties of common beech are influenced by a number of factors and that each of the investigated properties is determined by a large number of genes the obtained results can be used in the breeding programme of common beech as well as in the activities related to the conservation of genetic variability using the in situ and ex situ methods homologs of tobacco mosaic virus 30k celltocell movement protein are encoded by diverse plant viruses mechanisms of action and evolutionary origins of these proteins remain obscure we expand the picture of conservation and evolution of the 30k proteins producing sequence alignment of the 30k superfamily with the broadest phylogenetic coverage thus far and illuminating structural features of the core allbeta fold of these proteins integrated copies of pararetrovirus 30k movement genes are prevalent in euphyllophytes with at least one copy intact in nearly every examined species and mrnas detected for most of them sequence analysis suggests repeated integrations pseudogenizations and positive selection in those provirus genes an unannotated

view of virus infection and pathogenesis and perhaps of cellular homeostasis in the hosts © 2014 the onset and conservation of genetic polymorphism is a major question in evolutionary ecology the influence of temporal fluctuations in the environment was invoked by early theorists such as jbs haldane and s jayakar in a controversial article published in 1963 but their frequently cited model has almost never been used with empirical evidence in this paper we present a simulation model inspired by the biology of common gorse ulex europaeus a species which shows polymorphism of flowering phenology long flowering plants produce flowers from winter to spring and short flowering plants only flower in the spring the early fruits of the former run the risk of frost but largely escape seed predation while those of the latter escape the risk of frost but are subject to a strong risk of seed predation these two selection pressures vary unpredictably from year to year making this flowering phenotype a good candidate to test haldane and jayakars model assuming that both flowering types are determined by a single major locus we devise a simulation model firstly in a diploid form and secondly by taking into account the hexaploid characteristic of gorse our results show that the combination of the two selective pressures acting on gorse flowering phenology can lead to fitness values meeting the haldane and jayakars conditions on geometric and arithmetic means and to long term maintenance of polymorphism in addition the values of the parameters allowing polymorphism persistence and the relative proportions obtained are in agreement with values observed in natural populations we also show that hexaploidy strongly increases the range of parameters in which polymorphism is self sustaining these results are discussed in the context of climatic change where increases of both mean temperature and its variance are predicted © 2014 elsevier bv mirnas are a class of small noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression they are involved in the control of many developmental processes including fruit development the increasing amount of information on mirnas on their expression abundance and conservation between various species provides a new opportunity to study the role of mirnas in nonmodel plant species in this work we used a combination of northern blot and tissue print hybridization analysis to identify conserved mirnas expressed during prickly pear cactus opuntia ficus indica fruit development comparative profiling detected the expression of 34 mirnas which were clustered in three different groups that were associated with the different phases of fruit development variation in the level of mirna expression was observed gradual expression increase of several mirnas was observed during fruit development including mir164 mir164 was selected for stemloop rtpcr and for a detailed spatial–temporal expression analysis at early floral stages mir164 was mainly localized in meristematic tissues boundaries and fusion zones while it was more homogenously expressed in fruit tissues our results provide the first evidence of mirna expression in the prickly pear cactus and provide the basis for future research on mirnas in opuntia moreover our analyses suggest that mir164 plays different roles during prickly pear cactus fruit development ©

atlantic forest passiflora actinia is an indigenous species from the southern atlantic forest and as such was influenced by climatic changes during the pleistocene in this study we investigated the effects of past climate changes on the genetic diversity of p actinia using nuclear and plastid markers we subsequently suggest strategies for the preservation of this species in particular and the whole ecoregion in general we employed phylogeographical methods and combined these results with past present and future ensemble niche models genetic variability in p actinia was similar to that of other species with similar geographical distributions and geographical structuring was not observed based on either type of genetic marker diversification in p actinia was dated to the pleistocene suggesting that climate changes could have influenced the distribution of genetic diversity in this species our results predicted that suitable p actinia habitat will persist in the highlands but will be reduced in the lowlands especially with higher greenhouse gas concentrations conservation efforts should focus on populations with unique genetic units and populations from areas with greater climatic instability habitat loss due to deforestation in the atlantic forest constitutes a major risk to this species especially to small populations or those with low diversity indices © 2016 the

challenge for genomic studies in particular the d subgenome is relatively lacking in genetic diversity making it both difficult to map genetically and a target for introgression of agriculturally useful traits elucidating its sequence and structure will therefore facilitate wheat breeding and crop improvement results we generated shotgun sequences from each arm of flowsorted triticum aestivum chromosome 5d using 454 flx titanium technology giving 134× and 161× coverage of the short 5ds and long 5dl arms of the chromosome respectively by a combination of sequence similarity and assemblybased methods 74 of the sequence reads were classified as repetitive elements and coding sequence models of 1314 5ds and 2975 5dl genes were generated the order of conserved genes in syntenic regions of previously sequenced grass genomes were integrated with physical and genetic map positions of 518 wheat markers to establish a virtual gene order for chromosome 5d conclusions the virtual gene order revealed a largescale chromosomal rearrangement in the pericentromeric region of 5dl and a concentration of nonsyntenic genes in the telomeric region of 5ds although our data support the largescale conservation of triticeae chromosome structure they also suggest that some regions are evolving rapidly through frequent gene duplications and translocations © 2014 lucas et al banksia is a

prairies with cultivars that are widely used in grassland restoration pastures and landscaping however these cultivars may be genetically dissimilar to small remnant populations raising concerns about altered genetic composition of native populations through gene flow to address this issue on a local scale in ohio and illinois we used microsatellite markers to characterize genetic diversity and differentiation of 10 remnant prairie populations 5 in each state and 8 common cultivars the bulk of genetic variation was found to reside within rather than among wild populations consistent with the outcrossing breeding system of switchgrass genetic diversity was similar among the remnant populations despite large differences in area approximately 22590ha highlighting the importance of small native populations as reservoirs of variation and potential seed sources for prairie restoration cultivars generally had similar levels of variation to the wild populations but we found clear genetic dissimilarity between wild and cultivated gene pools especially for kanlow but also trailblazer blackwell dacotah summer and sunburst cultivars this suggests that using cultivars in local prairie restoration efforts may alter the genetic composition of wild populations whether such changes are deemed as negative depends on the cultivar under consideration and specific conservation goals for

transformed or agroinfiltrated therefore it is commonly used in studies requiring protein localization interaction or plantbased systems for protein expression and purification to discover and characterize the mirnas and their cleaved target mrnas in n benthamiana we sequenced small rna transcriptomes and degradomes of two n benthamiana accessions and validated them by northern blots results we used a comprehensive molecular approach to detect and to experimentally validate n benthamiana mirnas and their target mrnas from various tissues we identified 40 conserved mirna families and 18 novel microrna candidates and validated their target mrnas with a genomic scale approach the accumulation of thirteen novel mirnas was confirmed by northern blot analysis the conserved and novel mirna targets were found to be involved in various biological processes including transcription rna binding dna modification signal transduction stress response and metabolic process among the novel mirna targets we found the mrna of repressor of silencing ros1 regulation of ros1 by a mirna provides a new regulatory layer to reinforce transcriptional gene silencing by a posttranscriptional repression of ros1 activity conclusions the identified conserved and novel mirnas along with their target mrnas also provides a tissue specific atlas of known and new mirna expression and their cleaved target mrnas of n benthamiana thus this study will serve as a valuable resource to the plant research community that will be beneficial well into the future © 2015 baksa et al premise of the study the persistence of rare and endangered plant species may depend on the distance pollinators travel when dispersing pollen pollinations between adjacent plants which are often genetically similar can decrease seed set germination andor progeny vigor due to shared s alleles or inbreeding depression interpopulation pollen dispersal is often suggested as a management tool to increase genetic diversity however longdistance pollinations also have the potential to decrease fitness methods we performed experimental hand pollinations in the field and germination experiments in a growth chamber to determine the effect of intrapopulation pollination distance 1 m 10 m and 100 m on seed set seed germination progeny growth and progeny reproduction in phlox hirsuta in addition we included interpopulation pollinations 6740 m to determine whether artificial gene flow is a viable management option for this endangered species key results although pollination distance did not affect the number of healthy seeds produced or the likelihood of radicle emergence it did significantly affect the ability of germinating seeds to successfully produce cotyledons outbreeding depression was observed during seed germination and early seedling development seedlings resulting from interpopulation pollinations developed more slowly and were less likely to survive to produce cotyledons than seedlings resulting from all three intrapopulation pollination distances conclusions our results suggest that the success of p hirsuta does not depend on the distance pollinators travel within populations and that conservation strategies that involve transporting genes between populations can be counterproductive © 2015 botanical society of america background and aimsclimate change is

asplenium fontanum along a southnorth transect extending from its putative last glacial maximum lgm refugia in southern france towards southern germany and easterncentral france this study reconciles observations from distribution models and phylogeographic analyses derived from plastid and nuclear diversitykey resultsgenetic diversity distribution and niche modelling propose that genetic diversity accumulates in the lgm climate refugium in southern france with the formation of a diversity gradient reflecting a slow postlgm range expansion towards the current distribution range evidence supports the ferns preference for outcrossing contradicting the expectation that homosporous ferns would populate new sites by singlespore colonization prediction of climate and distribution range change suggests that a dramatic loss of range and genetic diversity in this fern is possible the observed migration is best described by the phalanx expansion modelconclusionsthe results suggest that homosporous ferns reproducing preferentially by outcrossing accumulate genetic diversity primarily in lgm climate refugia and may be threatened if these areas disappear due to global climate

beepollinated and easily recognizable by its purple and salverform corolla it was described as a new species of the petunia genus in 2005 few individuals of p secreta have been observed in nature and little is known about this species all the natural populations of p secreta that were found were studied using 15 microsatellite loci two intergenic plastid sequences and morphological traits statistical analysis was performed to describe the genetic diversity of this rare species and the results compared with those of more widespread and frequent petunia species from the same geographic area to understand whether factors associated with population size could affect rare species of this genus the results showed that despite its rarity p secreta presented high genetic diversity that was equivalent to or even higher than that of widespread petunia species it was shown that this species is divided into two evolutionary lineages and the genetic differentiation indices between them and other congeneric species presented different patterns the major risk to p secreta maintenance is its rarity suggesting the necessity of a preservation programme and more biological and

species however we know surprisingly little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the locally adapted traits involved in ecotype formation the genetic architecture underlying locally adapted traits dictates how an organism will respond to environmental selection pressures and has major implications for evolutionary ecology conservation and crop breeding to understand the genetic architecture underlying the divergence of switchgrass panicum virgatum ecotypes we constructed a genetic mapping population through a fourway outbred cross between two northern upland and two southern lowland accessions trait segregation in this mapping population was largely consistent with multiple independent loci controlling the suite of traits that characterizes ecotype divergence we assembled a joint linkage map using ddradseq and mapped quantitative trait loci qtl for traits that are divergent between ecotypes including flowering time plant size physiological processes and disease resistance overall we found that most qtl had small to intermediate effects while we identified colocalizing qtl for multiple traits we did not find any largeeffect qtl that clearly controlled multiple traits through pleiotropy or tight physical linkage these results indicate that ecologically important traits in switchgrass have a complex genetic basis and that similar loci may underlie divergence across

total of 577 accessions by analysing the genetic spatial patterns of the wild common bean we documented the existence of several genetic groups and the occurrence of variable degrees of diversity in mesoamerica and the andes moreover using a landscape genetics approach we demonstrated that both demographic processes and selection for adaptation were responsible for the observed genetic structure we showed that the study of correlations between markers and ecological variables at a continental scale can help in identifying local adaptation genes we also located putative areas of common bean

nonflowering varieties with higher vegetative yields is an important goal in ramie improvement however the ramie genes involved in flowering regulation have not previously been identified in model plants such as rice and arabidopsis the constans  co and constanslike  col genes play key roles in flowering regulation in the present study six ramie col genes  bncol1 bncol6 with a fulllength open reading frame orf were identified sequence alignment revealed that all six bncol proteins contained conserved cct  co col toc1 and bbox i domains but that only four of these proteins contained the bbox ii domain expression pattern analysis showed that bncol1 bncol6 were mainly expressed in the stem xylem flowers and leaves phylogenetic analysis classified the six newly identified bncol proteins and also 16 col proteins with known functions in other species into three groups the bncol2encoded protein was assigned to the same group as the co and hd1encoded proteins suggesting that this bncol2encoded protein showed the highest level of homology with the co hd1encoded proteins photoperiodic experiments showed that bncol2 exhibited a diurnal expression pattern under long and shortday conditions subcellular localization examination revealed that the bncol2 protein fused with yfp was localized in the nucleus because the homologous sequence and similar expression pattern between bncol2 and co hd1 the bncol2 possibly has a role in flowering modulation and can be used as a candidate gene for research in the flowering regulation of ramie © 2015 elsevier bv background methods are needed for the conservation of clonally maintained trees of populus and salix in this work populus trichocarpa and salix genetic resources were cryopreserved using dormant scions as the source explant
objective we quantified the recovery of cryopreserved materials that originated from diverse field environments by using either direct sprouting or grafting
materials and methods scions either at their original moisture content of 48 to 60 or dried to 30 were slowly cooled to 35 degree c transferred to the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen lnv 160 degree c and warmed before determining survival
results dormant buds from p trichocarpa clones from westport and boardman or had regrowth levels between 42 and 100 direct rooting of cryopreserved p trichocarpa was also possible ten of 11 cryopreserved salix accessions representing 10 different species exhibited at least 40 bud growth and rooting after 6 weeks when a bottomheated rooting system was implemented
conclusion we demonstrate that dormant buds of p trichocarpa and salix accessions can be cryopreserved and successfully regenerated without the use of tissue culture background the loliumfestuca

important to world agriculture species within the loliumfestuca complex show very diverse phenotypes and many of them are related to agronomically important traits analysis of sequenced transcriptomes of these nonmodel species may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic diversity results we have generated de novo transcriptome assemblies for four species from the loliumfestuca complex ranging from 52166 to 72133 transcripts per assembly we have also predicted a set of proteins and validated it with a highconfidence protein database from three closely related species h vulgare b distachyon and o sativa we have obtained gene family clusters for the four species using orthomcl and analyzed their inferred phylogenetic relationships our results indicate that vrn2 is a candidate gene for differentiating vernalization and nonvernalization types in the loliumfestuca complex grouping of the gene families based on their blast identity enabled us to divide ortholog groups into those that are very conserved and those that are more evolutionarily relaxed the ratio of the nonsynonumous to synonymous substitutions enabled us to pinpoint protein sequences evolving in response to positive selection these proteins may explain some of the differences between the more stress tolerant festuca and the less stress tolerant lolium species conclusions our data presents a comprehensive transcriptome sequence comparison between species from the loliumfestuca complex with the identification of potential candidate genes underlying some important phenotypical differences within the complex such as vrn2 the orthologous genes between the species have a very high id 9161 and the majority of gene families were shared for all of them it is likely that the

coconut tissue culture and associated biotechnological interventions but also future research directions toward the resilience of this important palm crop coconut cocos nucifera l is commonly known as the ‘tree of life’ every component of the palm can be used to produce items of value and many can be converted into industrial products coconut cultivation faces a number of acute problems that reduce its productivity and competitiveness these problems include various biotic and abiotic challenges as well as an unstable market for its traditional oilbased products around 10 million smallholder farmers cultivate coconut palms worldwide on c 12 million hectares of land and many more people own a few coconut palms that contribute to their livelihoods inefficiency in the production of seedlings

towards developing and improving protocols for i embryo culture ii clonal propagation via somatic embryogenesis iii homozygote production via anther culture iv germplasm conservation via cryopreservation and v genetic transformation recently other advances have revealed possible new ways to improve these protocols although effective embryo culture and cryopreservation are now possible the limited frequency of conversion of somatic embryos to ex vitro seedlings still prevents the largescale clonal propagation of coconut this review illustrates how our knowledge of tissue culture and

podocarpus sellowii podocarpaceae is one of only a few gymnosperms native to brazil and the sole species of the genus found in the northeastern region of that country it has a very restricted distribution in this region with only three known populations in highland forests called brejos de altitude which apparently have been isolated from each other since the pleistocene due to this longterm isolation and the fact that these populations have few adult individuals and suffer great anthropogenic pressure low genetic variability is expected compromising their longterm viability the present work assessed the genetic variability and structure of northeastern populations of p sellowii to investigate the role of pleistocene glaciations on the genetic relationships between them and to propose strategies for their conservation by analyzing the ssr and issr markers of adult and juvenile individuals low genetic diversity was found with both markers associated with a high differentiation of the brejo de baturité population in relation to the others—suggesting their isolation at different points in time probably during the pleistocene actions directed towards increasing

limited gene dispersal among forest fragments despite a homogeneous level of migration among populations notwithstanding the gene flow among populations significant sgs is still found in some fragments significant spatial genetic structure within population was also found likely as result of limited seed andor pollen dispersal the scattered distribution of the populations and their relatively high density seem to limit pollen dispersal also seed dispersal by wind is not efficient due to large distances among forest formations as conservationist actions towards preserving the

and developmental aberrations in the anatomy and physiology of the plantlets attributed to in vitro culture conditions of high humidity low light levels and hetero or mixotrophic conditions some of the cultureinduced anomalies become genetic and the phenotype is inherited by clonal progenies while others are temporary and can be corrected at a later stage of protocol development through changes

management conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources in higher plants studies providing insights into the mechanisms creating and maintaining sympatric cryptic lineages are rare here using microsatellites and chloroplast sequence data morphometric analyses and phenological observations we ask whether sympatrically coexisting lineages in the common wetland plant juncus effusus are ecologically differentiated and reproductively isolated our results show two genetically highly differentiated homoploid lineages within j effusus that are morphologically cryptic and have similar preference for soil moisture content however flowering time differed significantly between the lineages contributing to reproductive isolation and the maintenance of these lineages furthermore the later flowering lineage suffered less from predispersal seed predation by a coleophora moth species still we detected viable and reproducing hybrids between both lineages and the earlier flowering lineage and j conglomeratus a coexisting close relative flowering time differentiation between the lineages can be explained by neutral divergence alone and together with a lack of postzygotic isolation mechanisms the sympatric coexistence of these lineages is most likely the result of an allopatric origin with secondary contact sympatric cryptic lineages are a challenge for the understanding of species coexistence and lineage diversification here we show that two homoploid and sympatrically coexisting lineages within a common wetland plant are genetically highly differentiated but morphologically cryptic we argue that the strong differentiation in flowering time contributes to reproductive isolation and the maintenance of these lineages © 2015 the authors

population size of this plant were associated with washing out and the settlement of gemmae vegetative propagation respectively the major cause of the reduction in the population size was an increase in the number of washedout individuals and not the decreased settlement of gemmae the washout rates for small and large individuals were not significantly different small individuals having a stream

mapping and reciprocal introgressions we show that changes in reproductive organ morphology have a simple genetic basis in animalpollinated plants flowers have evolved to optimize pollination efficiency by different pollinator guilds and hence reproductive success the two petunia species paxillaris and p exserta display pollination syndromes adapted to moth or hummingbird pollination for the floral traits color and scent genetic loci of large phenotypic effect have been well documented however such largeeffect loci may be typical for shifts in simple biochemical traits whereas the evolution of morphological traits may involve multiple mutations of small phenotypic effect here we performed a quantitative trait locus qtl analysis of floral morphology followed by an indepth study of pistil and stamen morphology and the introgression of individual qtl into reciprocal parental backgrounds two qtls on chromosomes ii and v are sufficient to explain the interspecific difference in pistil and stamen length since most of the difference in organ length is caused by differences in cell number genes underlying these qtls are likely to be involved in cell cycle regulation interestingly conservation of the locus on chromosome ii in a different p axillaris subspecies suggests that the evolution of organ elongation was initiated on chromosome ii in adaptation to different pollinators we recently showed that qtls for pistil and stamen length on chromosome ii are tightly linked to qtls for petal color and volatile emission linkage of multiple traits will enable major phenotypic change within a few generations in hybridizing populations thus the genomic architecture of pollination syndromes in petunia allows for rapid responses to changing pollinator availability ©

bacteria and plant plastids contributes to this dark adaptation levels of the stringent response alarmone guanosine 3′diphosphate 5′diphosphate ppgpp rise after a shift from light to dark indicating that darkness triggers the same response in cyanobacteria as starvation in heterotrophic bacteria high levels of ppgpp are sufficient to stop growth and dramatically alter many aspects of cellular physiology including levels of photosynthetic pigments and polyphosphate dna content and the rate of translation cells unable to synthesize ppgpp display pronounced growth defects after exposure to

ecosystem in the colorado rocky mountains focusing on four alpine bumble bee species  bombus balteatus b flavifrons b bifarius and b sylvicola and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization  trifolium dasyphyllum and t parryi  using microsatellites we found that estimated colony abundances among bombus species ranged from ∼18 to 78 colonies001 km2 the longtongued species b balteatus was most common especially high above treeline but the subalpine species b bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all bombus species ranging from 25 to 110 m fruit set for the specialized plant trifolium parryi was positively related to the abundance of its bombus pollinator in contrast fruit set for the generalized plant t dasyphyllum was related to abundance of all bombus species because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the

beneficial effects include better water conservation in leaves less electrolyte leakage steady chlorophyll contents and greater photosynthetic performance under stress conditions melatonin selectively downregulates mdnced3 an abscisic acid aba synthesis gene and upregulates its catabolic genes mdcyp707a1 and mdcyp707a2 thereby reducing aba contents in droughtstressed plants melatonin also directly scavenges hinf2infoinf2inf and enhances the activities of antioxidant enzymes to detoxify hinf2infoinf2inf indirectly these two mechanisms work synergistically to improve the functions of stomata ie causing them to reopen plants can effectively regulate their water balance under drought conditions by upregulating the expression of melatonin synthesis genes mdtdc1 mdaanat2 mdt5h4 and mdasmt1

traditional chinese herb the lack of information regarding the genetic structure and genetic relationships among its cultivars has hindered the conservation and utilization of this resource this study used start codon targeted markers to assess the genetic diversity and other genetic characteristics of five singlevariety l macranthoides populations in china using 22 primers produced a total of 266

strengthen the exchange of germplasm and increase the mutual penetration of useful genes which would broaden the hereditary basis of l macranthoides © funpecrp replication protein a rpa is a heterotrimeric singlestranded dna binding complex required for eukaryotic dna replication repair and recombination rpa is composed of three subunits rpa1 rpa2 and rpa3 in contrast to single rpa subunit genes generally found in animals and yeast plants encode multiple paralogs of rpa subunits suggesting subfunctionalization genetic analysis demonstrates that five arabidopsis thaliana rpa1 paralogs rpa1a to rpa1e have unique and overlapping functions in dna replication repair and meiosis we hypothesize here that rpa1 subfunctionalities will be reflected in major structural and sequence differences among the paralogs to address this we analyzed amino acid and nucleotide sequences of rpa1 paralogs from 25 complete genomes representing a wide spectrum of plants and unicellular green algae we find here that the plant rpa1 gene family is divided into three general groups termed rpa1a rpa1b and rpa1c which likely arose from two progenitor groups in unicellular green algae in the family brassicaceae the rpa1b and rpa1c groups have further expanded to include two unique subfunctional paralogs rpa1d and rpa1e respectively in addition rpa1 groups have unique domains motifs ciselements gene expression profiles and pattern of conservation that are consistent with proposed functions in monocot and dicot species including a novel cterminal zincfinger domain found only in plant rpa1clike sequences these results allow for improved prediction of rpa1 subunit functions in newly sequenced plant genomes and potentially provide a unique molecular tool to improve

vegetated moist depressions within dolomite prairies that become ephemeral wetlands in the spring classified as endangered in portions of its range illinois and kentucky little is known about the ecology and genetics of i butleri in illinois the five known populations are disjunct from all other known populations and there is concern that these populations could be vulnerable to a number of threats including a lack of suitable microhabitats displacement by other plant species accumulation of plant litter and low genetic diversity and limited gene flow we evaluated these putative threats by analyzing demographic data collected by plants of concern a citizenscience rareplant monitoring program performing experimental litter removals and assessing population genetic structure there were no significant differences in soil nutrient availability in topographically similar depressions with and without i butleri however areas inhabited by i butleri had lower abundance of woody species and higher abundance of conservative habitat specialist species than uninhabited areas following experimental litter removal i butleri exhibited lower size but higher density and recruitment we found that all populations had high genetic diversity however there was also evidence of high inbreeding which may be due to spatially finescale genetic structure and poor dispersal ability our findings suggest that reductions of woody plant growth and accumulated litter—both of which can be achieved through prescribed fire—should be management priorities for i butleri conservation © 2017 elsevier bv background recently it has been proposed that the genetic diversity of foundation species influences the structure and function of the community by creating locally stable conditions for other species and modulating ecosystem dynamics oak species are an ideal system to test this hypothesis because many of them have a wide geographical distribution and they are dominant elements of the forest canopy in this study we explored the response of canopy arthropod community structure diversity and biomass to the level of genetic diversity of quercus crassipes and q rugosa two important canopy species also we examined the effect of oak species and locality on some community structure parameters diversity biomass rare species and richness of arthropod fauna of canopy arthropods in total 160 canopies were fogged in four localities at the mexican valley ten trees per species per locality per season results q crassipes registered the highest number of rare species diversity index biomass and richness in comparison with q rugosa we found a positive and significant relationship between genetic diversity parameters and canopy arthropod diversity however canopy arthropod biomass registered an inverse pattern our results support the hypothesis that the genetic diversity of the hostplant species influences the assemblage of the canopy arthropod community conclusions the pattern found in our study provides a powerful tool when trying to predict the effects of the genetic diversity of the hostplant species on different community structure parameters which permits assignment of a new

sandalioticum populations both principal coordinates analysis pcoa and structure analysis of issr and ssr data highlighted low population structure although two populations appeared to be clearly distinct from the others the genetic pattern of the two taxa associated with their different ecological positions indicated resilience of r sandalioticum populations in fresh and humid habitats and

measured nested analysis of variance multicomparison principal components analysis cluster analysis and correlation analysis were used to study the leaf phenotypic variation and its relation to environmental factors result 1 analysis of nested variance for all the traits showed significant differences among and within populations 2 the mean phenotypic differentiation coefficient for all the traits was 4669 and the variation within populations 3183 was higher than that among populations 2885 indicating that the variance within population is the main source of the phenotypic variation of the species 3 the range of variation of coefficient of variance among the 17 traits was 4172625 and the average was 1256 4 the leaf phenotypic variation of t sinense was related to the environmental factors such as mean annual sunshine duration mean temperature in july and mean annual precipitation the gradient rule of leaf phenotypic characteristics is presented along with longitude latitude and

plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes the relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because i dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse or produce propagules to be dispersed to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns ii by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape and iii dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity such as species assembly in speciesrich communities the steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address

plant species for nuclear mitochondrial interaction studies due to availability of large collection of alloplasmic lines these lines exhibit different vegetative and physiological properties than their parents to investigate the level of sequence changes introduced into the mitochondrial genome under the alloplasmic condition three mitochondrial genomes of the triticumaegilops species were sequenced 1 durum alloplasmic line with the ae longissima cytoplasm that carries the t turgidum nucleus designated as lo durum 2 the cytoplasmic donor line and 3 the nuclear donor lineresults the mitochondrial genome of the t turgidum was 451678 bp in length with high structural and nucleotide identity to the previously characterized t aestivum genome the assembled mitochondrial genome of the lo durum and the ae longissima were 431959 bp and 399005 bp in size respectively the high sequence coverage for all three genomes allowed analysis of heteroplasmy within each genome the mitochondrial genome structure in the alloplasmic line was genetically distant from both maternal and paternal genomes the alloplasmic durum and the ae longissima carry the same versions of atp6 nad6 rps19p cob and cox2 exon 2 which are different from the t turgidum parent evidence of paternal leakage was also observed by analyzing nad9 and orf359 among all three lines nucleotide search identified a number of open reading frames of which 27 were specific to the lo durum lineconclusions several heteroplasmic regions were observed within genes and intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genomes of all three lines the number of rearrangements and nucleotide changes in the mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line that have occurred in less than half a century was significant considering the high sequence conservation between the t turgidum and the t aestivum that diverged from each other 10000 years ago we showed that the changes in genes were not limited to paternal leakage but were sufficiently significant to suggest that other mechanisms such as recombination and mutation were responsible the newly formed orfs differences in gene sequences and copy numbers heteroplasmy and

conservation of cwr in the czech republic is comprehensive at present with all but one priority cwr species being contained in protected areas active in situ cwr conservation could be focussed within 11 ca 10kmby10km grid cells containing 94 of priority species or their overlapping protected areas to augment the genetic coverage of the in situ conservation network active cwr conservation is encouraged within 11 supplementary areas meanwhile there are huge gaps in ex situ collections with no known conserved material for 134 of the 204 priority species furthermore existing accessions are generally unrepresentative of genetic diversity main conclusions in the czech republic active in situ conservation of priority cwr should be instigated within the 22 recommended grid cell areas or

to address this issue we carried out the first wholepopulation genetic characterisation of a small and isolated refugial population of the iucn redlisted serbian spruce picea omorika panč purk from the balkans all 418 adult individuals were georeferenced and genotyped at nuclear estssrs and at a mitochondrial mtdna locus spatial autocorrelation analyses provided only a simplified description of fsgs which is concordant with findings in windpollinated species with limited seed dispersal however bayesian analysis revealed three heterogeneous highly differentiated pairwise g’st gt 03 and spatially localised subpopulations showing only partial overlap with the distribution of mtdna haplotypes such complex structure in only 034 ha resulting mainly from historical events restrictions to gene flow and high local density was undetected in previous work based on more traditional sampling schemes for population genetics surveys we demonstrate the usefulness of sampling schemes leaning towards a wholepopulation genetic characterisation in mining the finest characteristics of fsgs and argue that our understanding of genetic structuring in highly heterogeneous refugial regions at both macro and microscales is still rather limited and often oversimplified this has severe implications on conservation of plant biodiversity from these regions in terms of responses to global climate

fragmented and continuous populations for each of two case studies we found that continuous populations harboured significantly greater allelic richness ar than fragmented ones we also found that fragmented populations exhibited two to threefold higher degree of genetic differentiation fst than continuous ones we did not found however significant differences for expected heterozygosity he and fixation index fis fragmentation effects are noticeable in c goeringii as ar was significantly reduced in fragmented populations the lack of significant differences for he would be attributable either to insufficient number of generations elapsed from the beginning of fragmentation to the high density of individuals in undisturbed populations or to both the loss of allelic diversity detected in disturbed populations of c goeringii is still small and could be recovered if the current moderate levels of gene flow are maintained and no further fragmentation is occurring © 2013
