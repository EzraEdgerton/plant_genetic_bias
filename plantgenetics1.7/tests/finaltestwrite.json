        "abstracttext": "{a carbohydrate esterase called glucuronoyl esterase (ge) was discovered\n   10 years ago in a cellulolytic system of the wood-rotting fungus\n   schizophyllum commune. genes coding for ges were subsequently found in a\n   number of microbial genomes, and a new family of carbohydrate esterases\n   (ce15) has been established. the multidomain structures of ges, together\n   with their catalytic properties on artificial substrates and positive\n   effect on enzymatic saccharification of plant biomass, led to the view\n   that the esterases evolved for hydrolysis of the ester linkages between\n   4-o-methyl-d-glucuronic acid of plant glucuronoxylans and lignin\n   alcohols, one of the crosslinks in the plant cell walls. this idea of\n   the function of ges is further supported by the effects of cloning of\n   fungal ges in plants and by very recently reported evidence for changes\n   in the size of isolated lignin-carbohydrate complexes due to uronic acid\n   de-esterification. these facts make ges interesting candidates for\n   biotechnological applications in plant biomass processing and genetic\n   modification of plants. this article is a brief summary of current\n   knowledge of these relatively recent and unexplored esterases.",

        "abstracttext": "{unreduced gametes, sperm or egg cells with the somatic chromosome\n   number, are an important mechanism of polyploid formation and gene flow\n   between heteroploid plants. the meiotic processes leading to unreduced\n   gamete formation are well documented, but the relative influence of\n   environmental and genetic factors on the frequency of unreduced gametes\n   remain largely untested. furthermore, direct estimates of unreduced\n   gametes based on dna content are technically challenging and, hence,\n   uncommon. here, we use flow cytometry to measure the contribution of\n   genetic (hybridization) and environmental (nutrient limitation,\n   wounding) changes to unreduced male gamete production in brassica napus,\n   sinapis arvensis and two hybrid lines. treatments were applied to\n   greenhouse grown plants in a random factorial design, with pollen\n   sampled at two time intervals. overall, the frequency of unreduced\n   gametes averaged 0.59\\% (range 0.06-2.17\\%), plus a single outlier with\n   27\\%. backcrossed hybrids had 39 to 75\\% higher unreduced gamete\n   production than parental genotypes, averaged across all treatments,\n   although the statistical significance of these differences depended on\n   sampling period and wounding treatment. unreduced gamete frequencies\n   were higher for the second sampling period than the first. there were no\n   direct effects of wounding or nutrient regime. our results indicate that\n   both genetic and environmental factors can induce increased unreduced\n   gametes, highlighting the potential importance of environmental\n   heterogeneity and genetic composition of populations in driving\n   polyploid evolution.",

        "abstracttext": "{wheat is one of the staple food crops worldwide and breeding for high\n   yield wheat is critical to meet the need of increasing world population.\n   to determine the factors that limit wheat yield potential in henan\n   province, china, 30 wheat cultivars that have been widely grown in henan\n   province since 1940s were evaluated for grain yield and related\n   physiological traits. the results show that grain yield has been\n   significantly increased since 1940s, with an annual genetic gain of\n   1.09\\%, and the increased yield after 1900s was attributed to the\n   introduction of 1bl/1rs translocation. the significant yield increase\n   mainly resulted from a significant increase in grain number per spike\n   (gnps), thousand kernel weight (tkw) and harvest index (hi), and a\n   significant decrease in plant height due to utilization of semi-dwarfing\n   genes. the genetic improvement of assimilate accumulation and\n   translocation was mainly reflected by the improvement in post-anthesis\n   assimilate accumulation (poaaa) and post-anthesis transportion rate\n   (poatr) of pre-anthesis assimilates (praa), with genetic gains of 0.63\\%\n   and 1.89\\%, respectively. the improvement of the poaaa was closely\n   related to an increase in net photosynthetic rates (p-n) of flag leaves\n   at anthesis and 20 days after anthesis, and leaf area index (lai) at 20\n   days after anthesis; whereas the improvement of the poatr of the praa\n   was closely associated with the improvement of accumulation and\n   redistribution of the assimilates accumulated in stems and sheaths. as\n   yield increased, the source-sink ratio significantly decreased,\n   reflecting that the source has been gradually becoming a limiting factor\n   to grain yield increase. therefore, diverse strategies should be adopted\n   to improve biomass (source) in future wheat breeding to meet the need of\n   continuous increasing in wheat yield.

        "abstracttext": "this is the first genetic study reporting on the interaction and molecular mapping of resistance to the barley grass stripe rust pathogen (puccinia striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei, psph) in common wheat. seedlings of 638 wheat accessions were tested and it was determined that wheat is a near-nonhost to psph based on rare susceptibility observed in <2% of commercial cultivars and <5% of wheat landraces. as previously observed for p. striiformis f. sp. tritici (pst), the australian cultivar teal was highly susceptible to psph. in contrast, a selection of cv. avocet carrying complementary resistance genes yr73 and yr74 (avocet r; avr) was resistant. the teal\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0avr (t/a) doubled haploid (dh) population was used to map resistance in avr to psph. infection types on the t/a dh lines inoculated with psph and pst indicated that all dh lines carrying both yr73 and yr74 were also resistant to psph; however, fewer dh lines were susceptible to psph than expected, suggesting the resistance was more complex. qtl analysis using 9053 dart-seq markers determined that resistance to psph was polygenically inherited and mapped to chromosomes 3a, 3d, 4a and 5b. the 3dl and 5bl markers co-located with yr73 and yr74, suggesting an overlap between host and non-host resistance mechanisms. \u00a9 2016 british society for plant pathology",

(), it has been brought to our attention that a short section of text in this article replicates text that first appeared in an article authored by june nasrallah (2015, p. 417). the sections in question are on p. 508 of sanabria et\u00a0al. and are replicated below, with quotation marks and correct attribution included. we apologize to our readers and to professor nasrallah for these errors. corrected text section, p. 508 parallels exist where plant si and plant immunity have similar outcomes, such as the elimination of undesirable cells or organisms. nasrallah (, p. 417) states: \u2018both immunity and at least some si systems (the crucifer and possibly the poppy systems) use highly variable receptors to recognize highly variable ligands. in addition, si systems that have biodestructive activity towards pollen tubes use components that are also used in defense. for example, programmed cell death and other reactions triggered in the incompatible pollen tubes of poppy are also induced during the plant immune response\u2019 (see also jordan et\u00a0al., dangl & jones, geitmann et\u00a0al., thomas & franklin-tong,). nasrallah (, p. 417) notes that \u2018another example relates to the nature of scr/sp11, the pollen determinant of si specificity in crucifers. scr/sp11 is similar in structure (mishima et\u00a0al., chookajorn et\u00a0al.,) although not in primary sequence, to defensins, the molecules of innate immunity that present a first line of defense to microbial challenge in plants and animals. \u2026 the similarity between the two classes of molecules suggests an evolutionary link, albeit a distant one, between crucifer si and innate immunity.\u2019 the most notable parallels, however, emerge from comparisons of the self-recognition loci and genes of plant si with those that control self/nonself recognition in a variety of recognition systems, the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (mhc) in particular (janeway & medzhitov,). as outlined by nasrallah (, p. 417) \u2018in both plants and animals, and from immunity to reproduction, self/nonself discrimination systems have been molded by similar selective pressures for diversification and coevolution of recognition functions, and by a shared requirement to maintain the genetic linkage of coadapted gene complexes\u2019. \u00a9 2016 the authors. new phytologist \u00a9 2016 new phytologist trust",

        "abstracttext": "glutaredoxins (grxs) are small proteins which bind glutathione to either reduce disulfide bonds or to coordinate iron sulfur clusters. whereas these well-established functions are associated with ubiquitously occurring grxs that encode variants of a cpyc or a cgfs motif in the active center, land plants also possess ccxc/s-type grxs (named roxys in arabidopsis thaliana) for which the biochemical functions are yet unknown. roxys and cc-type grxs from rice and maize physically and genetically interact with bzip transcription factors of the tga family to control developmental and stress-associated processes. here we demonstrate that roxys interact with transcriptional co-repressors of the topless (tpl) family which are related to tup1 in fungi and groucho/tle in animals. in roxys, the functionally important conserved a(l/i)w(l/v) motif at the very c terminus mediates the interaction with tpl. a ternary tga2/roxy19/tpl complex is formed when all three proteins are co-expressed in yeast. loss-of-function evidence for the role of tpl in roxy19-mediated repression was hampered by the redundancy of the five members of the tpl gene family and developmental defects of higher order tpl mutants. as an alternative strategy, we ectopically expressed known tpl-interacting proteins in order to out-compete the amount of available tpl in transiently transformed protoplasts. indeed, roxy19-mediated transcriptional repression was strongly alleviated by this approach. our data suggest a yet unrecognized function of grxs acting as adapter proteins for the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes on tga-regulated target promoters. \u00a9 2016",

        "abstracttext": "background: sunflower verticillium wilt (svw) is a vascular disease caused by root infection with verticillium dahliae (v. dahlia). it is a serious threat to the yield and quality of sunflower. however, chemical and agronomic measures for controlling this disease are not effective. the selection of more resistant genotypes is a desirable strategy to reduce contamination. a deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis underlying sunflower verticillium wilt is necessary to accelerate breeding progress. results: an rna-seq approach was used to perform global transcriptome profiling on the roots of resistant (s18) and susceptible (p77) sunflower genotypes infected with v. dahlia. different pairwise transcriptome comparisons were examined over a time course (6, 12 and 24 h, and 2, 3, 5 and 10 d post inoculation). in rd, sd and d datasets, 1231 genes were associated with svw resistance in a genotype-common transcriptional pattern. moreover, 759 and 511 genes were directly related to svw resistance in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively, in a genotype-specific transcriptional pattern. most of the genes were demonstrated to participate in plant defense responses; these genes included peroxidase (pod), glutathione peroxidase, aquaporin pip, chitinase, l-ascorbate oxidase, and lrr receptors. for the up-regulated genotype-specific differentially expressed genes (degs) in the resistant genotype, higher average fold-changes were observed in the resistant genotype compared to those in the susceptible genotype. an inverse effect was observed in the down-regulated genotype-specific degs in the resistant genotype. kegg analyses showed that 98, 112 and 52 genes were classified into plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction and flavonoid biosynthesis categories, respectively. many of these genes, such as cngc, rboh, fls2, jaz, myc2 npr1 and tga, regulate crucial points in defense-related pathway and may contribute to v. dahliae resistance in sunflower. conclusions: the transcriptome profiling results provided a clearer understanding of the transcripts associated with the crosstalk between sunflower and v. dahliae. the results identified several differentially expressed unigenes involved in the hyper sensitive response (hr) and the salicylic acid (sa)/jasmonic acid (ja)-mediated signal transduction pathway for resistance against v. dahliae. these results are useful for screening resistant sunflower genotypes. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

        "abstracttext": "the domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: vernalization1 (vrn1), vrn2, and flowering locus t (ft). previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of vrn1 and ft are conserved in brachypodium distachyon yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of vrn2. to investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference b. distachyon accession bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession abr6. resequencing of abr6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the f4 stage of the mapping population. flowering time was evaluated in f4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the b. distachyon homologs of the major flowering pathway genes vrn2 and ft, whereas no linkage was observed at vrn1. characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. however, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. studying the interaction of these regulators in b. distachyon provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals. \u00a9 2017 american society of plant biologists. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "solid tumors are multiscale, open, complex, dynamic systems: complex because they have many interacting components, dynamic because both the components and their interactions can change with time, and open because the tumor freely communicates with surrounding and even distant host tissue. thus, it is not surprising that striking intratumoral variations are commonly observed in clinical imaging such as mri and ct and that several recent studies found striking regional variations in the molecular properties of cancer cells from the same tumor. interestingly, this spatial heterogeneity in molecular properties of tumor cells is typically ascribed to branching clonal evolution due to accumulating mutations while macroscopic variations observed in, for example, clinical mri scans are usually viewed as functions of blood flow. the clinical significance of spatial heterogeneity has not been fully determined but there is a general consensus that the varying intratumoral landscape along with patient factors such as age, morbidity and lifestyle, contributes significantly to the often unpredictable response of individual patients within a disease cohort treated with the same standard-of-care therapy. here we investigate the potential link between macroscopic tumor heterogeneity observed by clinical imaging and spatial variations in the observed molecular properties of cancer cells. we build on techniques developed in landscape ecology to link regional variations in the distribution of species with local environmental conditions that define their habitat. that is, we view each region of the tumor as a local ecosystem consisting of environmental conditions such as access to nutrients, oxygen, and means of waste clearance related to blood flow and the local population of tumor cells that both adapt to these conditions and, to some extent, change them through, for example, production of angiogenic factors. furthermore, interactions among neighboring habitats can produce broader regional dynamics so that the internal diversity of tumors is the net result of complex multiscale somatic darwinian interactions. methods in landscape ecology harness darwinian dynamics to link the environmental properties of a given region to the local populations which are assumed to represent maximally fit phenotypes within those conditions. consider a common task of a landscape ecologist: defining the spatial distribution of species in a large region, e.g., in a satellite image. clearly the most accurate approach requires a meter by meter survey of the multiple square kilometers in the region of interest. however, this is both impractical and potentially destructive. instead, landscape ecology breaks the task into component parts relying on the darwinian interdependence of environmental properties and fitness of specific species\u2019 phenotypic and genotypic properties. first, the satellite map is carefully analyzed to define the number and distribution of habitats. then the species distribution in a representative sampling of each habitat is empirically determined. ultimately, this permits sufficient bridging of spatial scales to accurately predict spatial distribution of plant and animal species within large regions. currently, identifying intratumoral subpopulations requires detailed histological and molecular studies that are expensive and time consuming. furthermore, this method is subject to sampling bias, is invasive for vital organs such as the brain, and inherently destructive precluding repeated assessments for monitoring post-treatment response and proteogenomic evolution. in contrast, modern cross-sectional imaging can interrogate the entire tumor noninvasively, allowing repeated analysis without disrupting the region of interest. in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (mri) provides exceptional spatial resolution and generates signals that are unique to the molecular constituents of tissue. here we propose that mri scans may be the equivalent of satellite images in landscape ecology and, with appropriate application of darwinian first principles and sophisticated image analytic methods, can be used to estimate regional variations in the molecular properties of cancer cells. we have initially examined this technique in glioblastoma, a malignant brain neoplasm which is morphologically complex and notorious for a fast progression from diagnosis to recurrence and death, making a suitable subject of noninvasive, rapidly repeated assessment of intratumoral evolution. quantitative imaging analysis of routine clinical mris from glioblastoma has identified macroscopic morphologic characteristics which correlate with proteogenomics and prognosis. the key to the accurate detection and forecasting of intratumoral evolution using quantitative imaging analysis is likely to be in the understanding of the synergistic interactions between observable intratumoral subregions and the resulting tumor behavior. \u00a9 springer science+business media new york 2017.",

(2) is there genetic diversity among the current in situ population? (3) has the current in situ genetic diversity increased or decreased from historical estimates in 2007. results indicated that the overall ex situ populations were lower in genetic (allelic) diversity compared to the in situ population, with some in situ populations not present in the refugia. overall, heterozygosity was moderate and ranged from ho = 0.530 to ho = 0.635 in the wild and ho = 0.549 to ho = 0.727 in the ex situ population. inbreeding coefficients (fis) were near zero or negative indicating that inbreeding is not common within the current populations (in situ and ex situ) suggesting that some populations have an excess of heterozygotes (negative fis). analysis of current in situ population structure indicated there are three unique genetic clusters in the san marcos river. comparison of the in situ population with historical analysis indicates the genetic diversity of the wild population is dynamic both temporally and spatially. the results indicate that z. texana exhibits a plastic reproductive system utilizing both asexual (vegetative) and sexual (flowering and seed production) reproduction. \u00a9 2015",

        "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the european continent is presently colonized by nine species of the genus pulsatilla, five of which are encountered only in mountainous regions of southwest and south-central europe. the remaining four species inhabit lowlands in the north-central and eastern parts of the continent. most plants of the genus pulsatilla are rare and endangered, which is why most research efforts focused on their biology, ecology and hybridization. the objective of this study was to develop genomic resources, including complete plastid genomes and nuclear rrna clusters, for three sympatric pulsatilla species that are most commonly found in central europe. the results will supply valuable information about genetic variation, which can be used in the process of designing primers for population studies and conservation genetics research. the complete plastid genomes together with the nuclear rrna cluster can serve as a useful tool in hybridization studies. methodology/principal findings: six complete plastid genomes and nuclear rrna clusters were sequenced from three species of pulsatilla using the illumina sequencing technology. four junctions between single copy regions and inverted repeats and junctions between the identified locally-collinear blocks (lcb) were confirmed by sanger sequencing. pulsatilla genomes of 120 unique genes had a total length of approximately 161\u2013162 kb, and 21 were duplicated in the inverted repeats (ir) region. comparative plastid genomes of newly-sequenced pulsatilla and the previously-identified plastomes of aconitum and ranunculus species belonging to the family ranunculaceae revealed several variations in the structure of the genome, but the gene content remained constant. the nuclear rrna cluster (18s-its1-5.8s-its2-26s) of studied pulsatilla species is 5795 bp long. among five analyzed regions of the rrna cluster, only internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2) enabled the molecular delimitation of closely-related pulsatilla patens and pulsatilla vernalis. conclusions/significance: the determination of complete plastid genome and nuclear rrna cluster sequences in three species of the genus pulsatilla is an important contribution to our knowledge of the evolution and phylogeography of those endangered taxa. the resulting data can be used to identify regions that are particularly useful for barcoding, phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. the investigated taxa can be identified at each stage of development based on their species-specific snps. the nuclear and plastid genomic resources enable advanced studies on hybridization, including identification of parent species, including their roles in that process. the identified nonsynonymous mutations could play an important role in adaptations to changing environments. the results of the study will also provide valuable information about the evolution of the plastome structure in the family ranunculaceae. \u00a9 2015 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",

        "abstracttext": "background: in recent years, dozens of arabidopsis and rice ccch-type zinc finger genes have been functionally studied, many of which confer important traits, such as abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, delayed leaf senescence and improved plant architecture. switchgrass (panicum virgatum) is an important bioenergy crop. identification of agronomically important genes and/or loci is an important step for switchgrass molecular breeding. annotating switchgrass ccch genes using translational genomics methods will help further the goal of understanding switchgrass genetics and creating improved varieties. results: taking advantage of the publicly-available switchgrass genomic and transcriptomic databases, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of switchgrass ccch genes (pvc3hs). a total of 103 pvc3hs were identified and divided into 21 clades according to phylogenetic analysis. genes in the same clade shared similar gene structure and conserved motifs. chromosomal location analysis showed that most of the duplicated pvc3h gene pairs are in homeologous chromosomes. evolution analysis of 19 selected pvc3h pairs showed that 42.1% of them were under diversifying selection. expression atlas of the 103 pvc3hs in 21 different organs, tissues and developmental stages revealed genes with higher expression levels in lignified cells, vascular cells, or reproductive tissues/organs, suggesting the potential function of these genes in development. we also found that eight pvc3hs in clade-xiv were orthologous to aba- or stress- responsive ccch genes in arabidopsis and rice with functions annotated. promoter and qrt-pcr analyses of clade-xiv pvc3hs showed that these eight genes were all responsive to aba and various stresses. conclusions: genome-wide analysis of pvc3hs confirmed the recent allopolyploidization event of tetraploid switchgrass from two closely-related diploid progenitors. the short time window after the polyploidization event allowed the existence of a large number of pvc3h genes with a high positive selection pressure onto them. the homeologous pairs of pvc3hs may contribute to the heterosis of switchgrass and its wide adaptation in different ecological niches. phylogenetic and gene expression analyses provide informative clues for discovering pvc3h genes in some functional categories. particularly, eight pvc3hs in clade-xiv were found involved in stress responses. this information provides a foundation for functional studies of these genes in the future. \u00a9 2015 yuan et al.; licensee biomed central.",

        "abstracttext": "background: micro (mi)rnas are important regulators of plant development. across plant lineages, dicer-like 1 (dcl1) proteins process long ds-like structures to produce micro (mi) rna duplexes in a stepwise manner. these mirnas are incorporated into argonaute (ago) proteins and influence expression of rnas that have sequence complementarity with mirnas. expression levels of agos are greatly regulated by plants in order to minimize unwarranted perturbations using mirnas to target mrnas coding for agos. agos may also have high promoter specificity-sometimes expression of ago can be limited to just a few cells in a plant. viral pathogens utilize various means to counter antiviral roles of agos including hijacking the host encoded mirnas to target agos. two host encoded mirnas namely mir168 and mir403 that target agos have been described in the model plant arabidopsis and such a mechanism is thought to be well conserved across plants because ago sequences are well conserved. results: we show that the interaction between ago mrnas and mirnas is species-specific due to the diversity in sequences of two mirnas that target agos, sequence diversity among corresponding target regions in ago mrnas and variable expression levels of these mirnas among vascular plants. we used mirna sequences from 68 plant species representing 31 plant families for this analysis. sequences of mir168 and mir403 are not conserved among plant lineages, but surprisingly they differ drastically in their sequence diversity and expression levels even among closely related plants. variation in mir168 expression among plants correlates well with secondary structures/length of loop sequences of their precursors. conclusions: our data indicates a complex ago targeting interaction among plant lineages due to mirna sequence diversity and sequences of mirna targeting regions among ago mrnas, thus leading to the assumption that the perturbations by viruses that use host mirnas to target antiviral agos can only be species-specific. we also show that rapid evolution and likely loss of expression of mir168 isoforms in tobacco is related to the insertion of mite-like transposons between mirna and mirna* sequences, a possible mechanism showing how mirnas are lost in few plant lineages even though other close relatives have abundantly expressing mirnas. \u00a9 2014 jagtap and shivaprasad",

        "abstracttext": "background: in higher plants, inorganic nitrogen is assimilated via the glutamate synthase cycle or gs-gogat pathway. gogat enzyme occurs in two distinct forms that use nadh (nadh-gogat) or fd (fd-gogat) as electron carriers. the goal of the present study was to characterize wheat fd-gogat genes and to assess the linkage with grain protein content (gpc), an important quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. results: we report the complete genomic sequences of the three homoeologous a, b and d fd-gogat genes from hexaploid wheat (triticum aestivum) and their localization and characterization. the gene is comprised of 33 exons and 32 introns for all the three homoeologues genes. the three genes show the same exon/intron number and size, with the only exception of a series of indels in intronic regions. the partial sequence of the fd-gogat gene located on a genome was determined in two durum wheat (triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cvs ciccio and svevo, characterized by different grain protein content. genomic differences allowed the gene mapping in the centromeric region of chromosome 2a. qtl analysis was conducted in the svevo6ciccio ril mapping population, previously evaluated in 5 different environments. the study co-localized the fd-gogat-a gene with the marker gwm-339, identifying a significant major qtl for gpc. conclusions: the wheat fd-gogat genes are highly conserved; both among the three homoeologous hexaploid wheat genes and in comparison with other plants. in durum wheat, an association was shown between the fd-gogat allele of cv svevo with increasing gpc - potentially useful in breeding programs. \u00a9 2014 nigro et al.",

        "abstracttext": "the internal transcribed spacers of the nuclear ribosomal rna gene cluster, termed its1 and its2, are the most frequently used nuclear markers for phylogenetic analyses across many eukaryotic groups including most plant families. the reasons for the popularity of these markers include: 1.) ease of amplification due to high copy number of the gene clusters, 2.) available cost-effective methods and highly conserved primers, 3.) rapidly evolving markers (i.e. variable between closely related species), and 4.) the assumption (and/or treatment) that these sequences are non-functional, neutrally evolving phylogenetic markers. here, our analyses of its1 and its2 for 50 species suggest that both sequences are instead under selective constraints to preserve proper secondary structure, likely to maintain complete self-splicing functions, and thus are not neutrally-evolving phylogenetic markers. our results indicate the majority of sequence sites are co-evolving with other positions to form proper secondary structure, which has implications for phylogenetic inference. we also found that the lowest energy state and total number of possible alternate secondary structures are highly significantly different between its regions and random sequences with an identical overall length and guanine-cytosine (gc) content. lastly, we review recent evidence highlighting some additional problematic issues with using these regions as the sole markers for phylogenetic studies, and thus strongly recommend additional markers and cost-effective approaches for future studies to estimate phylogenetic relationships. \u00a9 2014 edger et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the date palm is one of the oldest cultivated fruit trees. it is critical in many ways to cultures in arid lands by providing highly nutritious fruit while surviving extreme heat and environmental conditions. despite its importance from antiquity, few genetic resources are available for improving the productivity and development of the dioecious date palm. to date there has been no genetic map and no sex chromosome has been identified.results: here we present the first genetic map for date palm and identify the putative date palm sex chromosome. we placed ~4000 markers on the map using nearly 1200 framework markers spanning a total of 1293 cm. we have integrated the genetic map, derived from the khalas cultivar, with the draft genome and placed up to 19% of the draft genome sequence scaffolds onto linkage groups for the first time. this analysis revealed approximately ~1.9 cm/mb on the map. comparison of the date palm linkage groups revealed significant long-range synteny to oil palm. analysis of the date palm sex-determination region suggests it is telomeric on linkage group 12 and recombination is not suppressed in the full chromosome.conclusions: based on a modified gentoyping-by-sequencing approach we have overcome challenges due to lack of genetic resources and provide the first genetic map for date palm. combined with the recent draft genome sequence of the same cultivar, this resource offers a critical new tool for date palm biotechnology, palm comparative genomics and a better understanding of sex chromosome development in the palms. \u00a9 2014 mathew et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: habitat loss and fragmentation may have detrimental impacts on genetic diversity, population structure and overall viability of tropical trees. the response of tropical trees to fragmentation processes may, however, be species, cohort or region-specific. here we test the hypothesis that forest fragmentation is associated with lower genetic variability and higher genetic differentiation in adult and seedling populations of prunus africana in north-western ethiopia. this is a floristically impoverished region where all but a few remnant forest patches have been destroyed, mostly by anthropogenic means.results: genetic diversity (based on allelic richness) was significantly greater in large and less-isolated forest patches as well as in adults than seedlings. nearly all pairwise fst comparisons showed evidence for significant population genetic differentiation. mean fst values were significantly greater in seedlings than adults, even after correction for within population diversity, but varied little with patch size or isolation.conclusions: analysis of long-lived adult trees suggests the formerly contiguous forest in north-western ethiopia probably exhibited strong spatial patterns of genetic structure. this means that protecting a range of patches including small and isolated ones is needed to conserve the extant genetic resources of the valuable forests in this region. however, given the high livelihood dependence of the local community and the high impact of foreign investors on forest resources of this region, in situ conservation efforts alone may not be helpful. therefore, these efforts should be supported with ex situ gene conservation actions. \u00a9 2014 yineger et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "gene and genome duplication events have created a large number of new genes in plants that can diverge by evolving new expression profiles and functions (neofunctionalization) or dividing extant ones (subfunctionalization). alternative splicing (as) generates multiple types of mrna from a single type of pre-mrna by differential intron splicing. it can result in new protein isoforms or downregulation of gene expression by transcript decay. using rna-seq, we investigated the degree to which alternative splicing patterns are conserved between duplicated genes in arabidopsis thaliana. our results revealed that 30% of as events in \u03b1-wholegenome duplicates and 33% of as events in tandem duplicates are qualitatively conserved within leaf tissue. loss of ancestral splice forms, as well as asymmetric gain of new splice forms, may account for this divergence. conserved events had different frequencies, as only 31% of shared as events in a-whole-genome duplicates and 41% of shared as events in tandem duplicates had similar frequencies in both paralogs, indicating considerable quantitative divergence. analysis of published rna-seq data from nonsensemediated decay (nmd) mutants indicated that 85% of a-whole-genome duplicates and 89% of tandem duplicates have diverged in their as-induced nmd. our results indicate that alternative splicing shows a high degree of divergence between paralogs such that qualitatively conserved alternative splicing events tend to have quantitative divergence. divergence in as patterns between duplicates may be a mechanism of regulating expression level divergence. \u00a9 2014 by the genetics society of america.",

        "abstracttext": "the flower itself, which comprises most of the evolutionary innovations of flowering plants, bears special significance for understanding the origin and diversification of angiosperms. the sudden origin of angiosperms in the fossil record poses unanswered questions on both the origins of flowering plants and their rapid spread and diversification. central to these questions is the role that the flower, and floral diversity, played. recent clarifications of angiosperm phylogeny provide the foundation for investigating evolutionary transitions in floral features and the underlying genetic mechanisms of stasis and change. the general features of floral diversity can best be addressed by considering key patterns of variation: an undifferentiated versus a differentiated perianth; elaboration of perianth organs in size and color; merosity of the flower; and phyllotaxy of floral organs. various models of gene expression now explain the regulation of floral organization and floral organ identity; the best understood are the abc(e) model and its modifications, but other gene systems are important in specific clades and require further study. furthermore, the propensity for gene and genome duplications in angiosperms provides abundant raw material for novel floral features - emphasizing the importance of understanding the conservation and diversification of gene lineages and functions in studies of macroevolution. \u00a9 springer science+business media, new york 2014.",

        "abstracttext": "background: genetic linkage maps are important tools for many genetic applications including mapping of quantitative trait loci (qtls), identifying dna markers for fingerprinting, and map-based gene cloning. carnation (dianthus caryophyllus l.) is an important ornamental flower worldwide. we previously reported a random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-based genetic linkage map derived from dianthus capitatus ssp. andrezejowskianus and a simple sequence repeat (ssr)-based genetic linkage map constructed using data from intraspecific f2 populations; however, the number of markers was insufficient, and so the number of linkage groups (lgs) did not coincide with the number of chromosomes (x = 15). therefore, we aimed to produce a high-density genetic map to improve its usefulness for breeding purposes and genetic research.results: we improved the ssr-based genetic linkage map using ssr markers derived from a genomic library, expression sequence tags, and rna-seq data. linkage analysis revealed that 412 ssr loci (including 234 newly developed ssr loci) could be mapped to 17 linkage groups (lgs) covering 969.6 cm. comparison of five minor lgs covering less than 50 cm with lgs in our previous rapd-based genetic map suggested that four lgs could be integrated into two lgs by anchoring common ssr loci. consequently, the number of lgs corresponded to the number of chromosomes (x = 15). we added 192 new ssrs, eight rapd, and two sequence-tagged site loci to refine the rapd-based genetic linkage map, which comprised 15 lgs consisting of 348 loci covering 978.3 cm. the two maps had 125 ssr loci in common, and most of the positions of markers were conserved between them. we identified 635 loci in carnation using the two linkage maps. we also mapped qtls for two traits (bacterial wilt resistance and anthocyanin pigmentation in the flower) and a phenotypic locus for flower-type by analyzing previously reported genotype and phenotype data.conclusions: the improved genetic linkage maps and ssr markers developed in this study will serve as reference genetic linkage maps for members of the genus dianthus, including carnation, and will be useful for mapping qtls associated with various traits, and for improving carnation breeding programs. \u00a9 2013 yagi et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the hsp20 genes are associated with stress caused by hs and other abiotic factors, but have recently been found to be associated with the response to biotic stresses. these genes represent the most abundant class among the hsps in plants, but little is known about this gene family in soybean. because of their apparent multifunctionality, these proteins are promising targets for developing crop varieties that are better adapted to biotic and abiotic stresses. thus, in the present study an in silico identification of gmhsp20 gene family members was performed, and the genes were characterized and subjected to in vivo expression analysis under biotic and abiotic stresses.results: a search of the available soybean genome databases revealed 51 gene models as potential gmhsp20 candidates. the 51 gmhsp20 genes were distributed across a total of 15 subfamilies where a specific predicted secondary structure was identified. based on in vivo analysis, only 47 soybean hsp20 genes were responsive to heat shock stress. among the gmhsp20 genes that were potentials hsr, five were also cold-induced, and another five, in addition to one gmacd gene, were responsive to meloidogyne javanica infection. furthermore, one predicted gmhsp20 was shown to be responsive only to nematode infection; no expression change was detected under other stress conditions. some of the biotic stress-responsive gmhsp20 genes exhibited a divergent expression pattern between resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes under m. javanica infection. the putative regulatory elements presenting some conservation level in the gmhsp20 promoters included hse, w-box, caat box, and ta-rich elements. some of these putative elements showed a unique occurrence pattern among genes responsive to nematode infection.conclusions: the evolution of hsp20 family in soybean genome has most likely involved a total of 23 gene duplications. the obtained expression profiles revealed that the majority of the 51 gmhsp20 candidates are induced under ht, but other members of this family could also be involved in normal cellular functions, unrelated to ht. some of the gmhsp20 genes might be specialized to respond to nematode stress, and the predicted promoter structure of these genes seems to have a particular conserved pattern related to their biological function. \u00a9 2013 lopes-caitar et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "wall-associated receptor-like kinases (waks) are important candidates for directly linking the extracellular matrix with intracellular compartments and are involved in developmental processes and stress response. wak gene family has been identified in plants such as arabidopsis and rice. here, we present a detailed analysis of the wak1 gene from barley cv. golden promise, mapped to chromosome 5h. three bac clones corresponding to the wak fragment were sequenced and the full-length wak1 gene was characterized. the gene has three exons and two short introns with a coding region of 2,178 bp encoding a protein of 725 amino acids. a regulatory region was analyzed in -1,000 bp sequence upstream to start codon. using conserved domains database and smart, various conserved domains such as gub wak bind, epidermal growth factor ca, and protein kinase c as well as other regions like signal peptides, active sites, and transmembrane domains were identified. the gene organization of hvwak1 was compared with wheat (tawak1) and arabidopsis (atwak1), suggesting that the wak1 gene organization has remained highly conserved. nonetheless, wak1 was found to be highly divergent when compared with sequences available from barley cv. haruna nijo (50 %), rice (46 %), wheat (21 %), arabidopsis (25 %), and maize (19 %). this divergence may have facilitated a better adaptation to surrounding environments due to its role in communication between the extracellular matrix, cell, and outer environment. semiquantitative rt-pcr-based expression analysis indicates hvwak1 expression is specific to roots. significant differences in root growth between gp wild type and gp-ds mutant seedlings were observed under control and salt stress conditions. \u00a9 2013 springer-verlag berlin heidelberg.",

        "abstracttext": "brassica rapa is an important crop species that produces vegetables, oilseed, and fodder. although many studies reported quantitative trait loci (qtl) mapping, the genes governing most of its economically important traits are still unknown. in this study, we report qtl mapping for morphological and yield component traits in b. rapa and comparative map alignment between b. rapa, b. napus, b. juncea, and arabidopsis thaliana to identify candidate genes and conserved qtl blocks between them. a total of 95 qtl were identified in different crucifer blocks of the b. rapa genome. through synteny analysis with a. thaliana, b. rapa candidate genes and intronic and exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms in the parental lines were detected from whole genome resequenced data, a few of which were validated by mapping them to the qtl regions. semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr analysis showed differences in the expression levels of a few genes in parental lines. comparative mapping identified five key major evolutionarily conserved crucifer blocks (r, j, f, e, and w) harbouring qtl for morphological and yield components traits between the a, b, and c subgenomes of b. rapa, b. juncea, and b. napus. the information of the identified candidate genes could be used for breeding b. rapa and other related brassica species. \u00a9 2012 the author. published by oxford university press on behalf of kazusa dna research institute.",

        "abstracttext": "populations of the large-flowered sandwort (arenaria grandiflora l.) in the fontainebleau forest (france) have declined rapidly during the last century. despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. the low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore fontainebleau populations. consequently, a. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the fontainebleau forest in 1999. each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. after establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. at present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil ph and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. this introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. to understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. from these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation. \u00a9 2013 maurice et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: most modern citrus cultivars have an interspecific origin. as a foundational step towards deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence was produced by the international citrus genome consortium from a haploid derived from clementine mandarin. the availability of a saturated genetic map of clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. clementine is believed to be a 'mediterranean' mandarin \u00d7 sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. the primary goals of the present study were to establish a clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and clementine.results: five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp), simple sequence repeats (ssr) and insertion-deletion (indel) markers. an initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cm) of the clementine was established by combining male and female clementine segregation data. this clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. the linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. however, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female clementine mapping data. the mapping data confirmed that clementine arose from hybridization between 'mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange. the results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the clementine genome.conclusions: a reference genetic map of citrus, used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the first citrus reference genome sequence, was established. the high conservation of marker order observed at the interspecific level should allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences by mapping next-generation sequencing (ngs) data in the reference genome sequence. the genome of the haploid clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence appears to have been inherited primarily from the 'mediterranean' mandarin. the high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the male clementine data underline the probable extent of deviation from mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in male parents. \u00a9 2012 ollitrault et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "maize (zea mays l.) is not only of worldwide importance as a food, feed and as a source of diverse industrially important products, but is also a model genetic organism with immense genetic diversity. although it was first domesticated in mexico, maize landraces are widely found across the continents. several studies in mexico and other countries highlighted the genetic variability in the maize germplasm. applications of molecular markers, particularly in the last two decades, have led to new insights into the patterns of genetic diversity in maize globally, including landraces as well as wild relatives (especially teosintes) in latin america, helping in tracking the migration routes of maize from the centers of origin, and understanding the fate of genetic diversity during maize domestication. the genome sequencing of b73 (a highly popular us corn belt inbred) and palomero (a popcorn landrace in mexico) in the recent years are important landmarks in maize research, with significant implications to our understanding of the maize genome organization and evolution. next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping platforms promise to further revolutionize our understanding of genetic diversity and for designing strategies to utilize the genomic information for maize improvement. however, the major limiting factor to exploit the genetic diversity in crops like maize is no longer genotyping, but high-throughput and precision phenotyping. there is an urgent need to establish a global phenotyping network for comprehensive and efficient characterization of maize germplasm for an array of target traits, particularly for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and nutritional quality. 'seeds of discovery' (seed), a novel initiative by cimmyt with financial support from the mexican government for generating international public goods, has initiated intensive exploration of phenotypic and molecular diversity of maize germplasm conserved in the cimmyt gene bank; this is expected to aid in effective identification and use of novel alleles and haplotypes for maize improvement. multi-institutional efforts are required at the global level to systematically explore the maize germplasm to diversify the genetic base of elite breeding materials, create novel varieties and counter the effects of global climate changes. \u00a9 indian academy of sciences.",

        "abstracttext": "cacao (theobroma cacao l.) is indigenous to the amazon basin, but is generally believed to have been domesticated in mesoamerica for the production of chocolate beverage. however, cacao's distribution of genetic diversity in south america is also likely to reflect pre-columbian human influences that were superimposed on natural processes of genetic differentiation. here we present the results of a spatial analysis of the intra-specific diversity of cacao in latin america, drawing on a dataset of 939 cacao trees genotypically characterized by means of 96 ssr markers. to assess continental diversity patterns we performed grid-based calculations of allelic richness, shannon diversity and nei gene diversity, and distinguished different spatially coherent genetic groups by means of cluster analysis. the highest levels of genetic diversity were observed in the upper amazon areas from southern peru to the ecuadorian amazon and the border areas between colombia, peru and brazil. on the assumption that the last glaciation (22,000-13,000 bp) had the greatest pre-human impact on the current distribution and diversity of cacao, we modeled the species' pleistocene niche suitability and overlaid this with present-day diversity maps. the results suggest that cacao was already widely distributed in the western amazon before the onset of glaciation. during glaciations, cacao populations were likely to have been restricted to several refugia where they probably underwent genetic differentiation, resulting in a number of genetic clusters which are representative for, or closest related to, the original wild cacao populations. the analyses also suggested that genetic differentiation and geographical distribution of a number of other clusters seem to have been significantly affected by processes of human management and accompanying genetic bottlenecks. we discuss the implications of these results for future germplasm collection and in situ, on farm and ex situ conservation of cacao. \u00a9 2012 thomas et al.",

        "abstracttext": "the benefits of ever-growing numbers of sequenced eukaryotic genomes will not be fully realized until we learn to decipher vast stretches of noncoding dna, largely composed of transposable elements. transposable elements persist through self-replication, but some genes once encoded by transposable elements have, through a process called molecular domestication, evolved new functions that increase fitness. although they have conferred numerous adaptations, the number of such domesticated transposable element genes remains unknown, so their evolutionary and functional impact cannot be fully assessed. systematic searches that exploit genomic signatures of natural selection have been employed to identify potential domesticated genes, but their predictions have yet to be experimentally verified. to this end, we investigated a family of domesticated genes called mustang (mug), identified in a previous bioinformatic search of plant genomes. we show that mug genes are functional. mutants of arabidopsis thaliana mug genes yield phenotypes with severely reduced plant fitness through decreased plant size, delayed flowering, abnormal development of floral organs, and markedly reduced fertility. mug genes are present in all flowering plants, but not in any non-flowering plant lineages, such as gymnosperms, suggesting that the molecular domestication of mug may have been an integral part of early angiosperm evolution. this study shows that systematic searches can be successful at identifying functional genetic elements in noncoding regions and demonstrates how to combine systematic searches with reverse genetics in a fruitful way to decipher eukaryotic genomes. \u00a9 2012 joly-lopez et al.",

        "abstracttext": "eggplant (solanum melongena l.) was domesticated in the indo-birmanian region, which is also the primary center of diversity for this crop. from there eggplant spread to other regions, and diversity accumulated in several secondary centers of diversity. we have assessed the diversity and relationships of 52 accessions of eggplant from three geographically distant secondary centers of diversity (china, spain, and sri lanka) using 28 morphological descriptors and 12 highly polymorphic genomic ssrs. a wide variation was found for most morphological traits, and significant differences among the three centers of diversity were detected for 22 of these traits. the pca analysis showed that eggplants from the three origins were morphologically differentiated, and accessions from each of the three secondary centers of diversity presented a typical combination of morphological characteristics. in this respect, discriminant analysis showed that accessions could be correctly classified to their origin using only six traits. the ssr characterization identified 110 alleles and allowed obtaining a unique genetic fingerprint for each accession. many alleles were found to be private to each origin, but no universal alleles were found for any of the origins. the pca analysis showed that the genetic differentiation among origins was less clear than for morphological traits, although the analysis of the population structure shows that accessions mostly group according to the origin, but also provides evidence of migration among the three secondary centers of diversity. the genetic diversity (ht) within each origin was high, ranging between ht = 0.5400 (sri lanka) and ht = 0.4943 (china), while the standardized genetic differentiation (g'st) among origins was moderate (g'st = 0.2657). the correlation between morphological and ssr distances was non-significant (r = 0.044), indicating that both data are complementary for the conservation of germplasm and breeding of eggplant. these results are relevant for the management of genetic resources, breeding programmes, and evolutionary studies of eggplant. \u00a9 2012 hurtado et al.",

        "abstracttext": "the effect of biodiversity on the ability of parasites to infect their host and cause disease (i.e. disease risk) is a major question in pathology, which is central to understand the emergence of infectious diseases, and to develop strategies for their management. two hypotheses, which can be considered as extremes of a continuum, relate biodiversity to disease risk: one states that biodiversity is positively correlated with disease risk (amplification effect), and the second predicts a negative correlation between biodiversity and disease risk (dilution effect). which of them applies better to different host-parasite systems is still a source of debate, due to limited experimental or empirical data. this is especially the case for viral diseases of plants. to address this subject, we have monitored for three years the prevalence of several viruses, and virus-associated symptoms, in populations of wild pepper (chiltepin) under different levels of human management. for each population, we also measured the habitat species diversity, host plant genetic diversity and host plant density. results indicate that disease and infection risk increased with the level of human management, which was associated with decreased species diversity and host genetic diversity, and with increased host plant density. importantly, species diversity of the habitat was the primary predictor of disease risk for wild chiltepin populations. this changed in managed populations where host genetic diversity was the primary predictor. host density was generally a poorer predictor of disease and infection risk. these results support the dilution effect hypothesis, and underline the relevance of different ecological factors in determining disease/infection risk in host plant populations under different levels of anthropic influence. these results are relevant for managing plant diseases and for establishing conservation policies for endangered plant species. \u00a9 2012 pag\u00e1n et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: ccch zinc finger proteins contain a typical motif of three cysteines and one histidine residues and serve regulatory functions at all stages of mrna metabolism. in plants, ccch type zinc finger proteins comprise a large gene family represented by 68 members in arabidopsis and 67 in rice. these ccch proteins have been shown to play diverse roles in plant developmental processes and environmental responses. however, this family has not been studied in the model tree species populus to date.results: in the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the genes encoding ccch zinc finger family in populus was performed. using a thorough annotation approach, a total of 91 full-length ccch genes were identified in populus, of which most contained more than one ccch motif and a type of non-conventional c-x11-c-x6-c-x3-h motif was unique for populus. all of the populus ccch genes were phylogeneticly clustered into 13 distinct subfamilies. in each subfamily, the gene structure and motif composition were relatively conserved. chromosomal localization of these genes revealed that most of the ccchs (81 of 90, 90 %) are physically distributed on the duplicated blocks. thirty-four paralogous pairs were identified in populus, of which 22 pairs (64.7 %) might be created by the whole genome segment duplication, whereas 4 pairs seem to be resulted from tandem duplications. in 91 ccch proteins, we also identified 63 putative nucleon-cytoplasm shuttling proteins and 3 typical rna-binding proteins. the expression profiles of all populus ccch genes have been digitally analyzed in six tissues across different developmental stages, and under various drought stress conditions. a variety of expression patterns of ccch genes were observed during populus development, of which 34 genes highly express in root and 22 genes show the highest level of transcript abundance in differentiating xylem. quantitative real-time rt-pcr (rt-qpcr) was further performed to confirm the tissue-specific expression and responses to drought stress treatment of 12 selected populus ccch genes.conclusions: this study provides the first systematic analysis of the populus ccch proteins. comprehensive genomic analyses suggested that segmental duplications contribute significantly to the expansion of populus ccch gene family. transcriptome profiling provides first insights into the functional divergences among members of populus ccch gene family. particularly, some ccch genes may be involved in wood development while others in drought tolerance regulation. our results presented here may provide a starting point for the functional dissection of this family of potential rna-binding proteins. \u00a9 2012 chai et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the repeated origin of similar phenotypes is invaluable for studying the underlying genetics of adaptive traits; molecular evidence, however, is lacking for most examples of such similarity. the floral morphology of neotropical malpighiaceae is distinctive and highly conserved, especially with regard to symmetry, and is thought to result from specialization on oil-bee pollinators. we recently demonstrated that cycloidea2-like genes (cyc2a and cyc2b) are associated with the development of the stereotypical floral zygomorphy that is critical to this plant-pollinator mutualism. here, we build on this developmental framework to characterize floral symmetry in three clades of malpighiaceae that have independently lost their oil bee association and experienced parallel shifts in their floral morphology, especially in regard to symmetry. we show that in each case these species exhibit a loss of cyc2b function, and a strikingly similar shift in the expression of cyc2a that is coincident with their shift in floral symmetry. these results indicate that similar floral phenotypes in this large angiosperm clade have evolved via parallel genetic changes from an otherwise highly conserved developmental program. \u00a9 2012 zhang et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: tree peonies are great ornamental plants associated with a rich ethnobotanical history in chinese culture and have recently been used as an evolutionary model. the qinling mountains represent a significant geographic barrier in asia, dividing mainland china into northern (temperate) and southern (semi-tropical) regions; however, their flora has not been well analyzed. in this study, the genetic differentiation and genetic structure of paeonia rockii and the role of the qinling mountains as a barrier that has driven intraspecific fragmentation were evaluated using 14 microsatellite markers. methodology/principal findings: twenty wild populations were sampled from the distributional range of p. rockii. significant population differentiation was suggested (f st value of 0.302). moderate genetic diversity at the population level (h s of 0.516) and high population diversity at the species level (h t of 0.749) were detected. significant excess homozygosity (f is of 0.076) and recent population bottlenecks were detected in three populations. bayesian clusters, population genetic trees and principal coordinate analysis all classified the p. rockii populations into three genetic groups and one admixed wenxian population. an isolation-by-distance model for p. rockii was suggested by mantel tests (r = 0.6074, p&lt;0.001) and supported by amova (p&lt;0.001), revealing a significant molecular variance among the groups (11.32%) and their populations (21.22%). these data support the five geographic boundaries surrounding the qinling mountains and adjacent areas that were detected with monmonier's maximum-difference algorithm. conclusions/significance: our data suggest that the current genetic structure of p. rockii has resulted from the fragmentation of a formerly continuously distributed large population following the restriction of gene flow between populations of this species by the qinling mountains. this study provides a fundamental genetic profile for the conservation and responsible exploitation of the extant germplasm of this species and for improving the genetic basis for breeding its cultivars. \u00a9 2012 yuan et al.",

        "abstracttext": "currently, due to the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices and the decline of rye production in portugal, there is a need to assess the genetic diversity of rye in order to preserve its biodiversity. furthermore, a greater knowledge of rye secalins is important for rye bread-making quality and other crop breeding purposes. the genetic variation and diversity of storage proteins were estimated for fourteen populations of rye (secale cereale l.) sampled in northern portugal. the work showed the high genetic diversity within the portuguese rye gene-pool as an important source for plant breeding and emphasized the necessity of an integrated resources genetic program to allow a more efficient management and conservation of these resources. the rye populations were compared with 'picasso' and 'marder' varieties. several alleles were identified by the single electrophoretic mobility patterns. we studied a set of 1600 rye seeds, including regional populations and varieties, having observed a total of 24, 5, 21 and 47 alleles for hmw, 75k \u03b3-, 40k \u03b3- and \u03c9-secalins, respectively. the coefficient of similarity within populations is presented using cluster representation. the mean value of genetic variation indices (h) for rye storage proteins was very high in regional populations, ranging from 0.67 to 0.78, while in the varieties ranged from 0.57 to 0.58. knowledge of the diversity of secalins will increase our understanding of the quality differences between rye varieties, especially considering the relative small number of rye cultivars grown around the world. \u00a9 2012 the authors.",

        "abstracttext": "background: coffee trees (rubiaceae) and tomato (solanaceae) belong to the asterid clade, while grapevine (vitaceae) belongs to the rosid clade. coffee and tomato separated from grapevine 125 million years ago, while coffee and tomato diverged 83-89 million years ago. these long periods of divergent evolution should have permitted the genomes to reorganize significantly. so far, very few comparative mappings have been performed between very distantly related species belonging to different clades. we report the first multiple comparison between species from asterid and rosid clades, to examine both macro-and microsynteny relationships.results: thanks to a set of 867 cosii markers, macrosynteny was detected between coffee, tomato and grapevine. while coffee and tomato genomes share 318 orthologous markers and 27 conserved syntenic segments (csss), coffee and grapevine also share a similar number of syntenic markers and csss: 299 and 29 respectively. despite large genome macrostructure reorganization, several large chromosome segments showed outstanding macrosynteny shedding new insights into chromosome evolution between asterids and rosids. we also analyzed a sequence of 174 kb containing the ovate gene, conserved in a syntenic block between coffee, tomato and grapevine that showed a high-level of microstructure conservation. a higher level of conservation was observed between coffee and grapevine, both woody and long life-cycle plants, than between coffee and tomato. out of 16 coffee genes of this syntenic segment, 7 and 14 showed complete synteny between coffee and tomato or grapevine, respectively.conclusions: these results show that significant conservation is found between distantly related species from the asterid (coffea canephora and solanum sp.) and rosid (vitis vinifera) clades, at the genome macrostructure and microstructure levels. at the ovate locus, conservation did not decline in relation to increasing phylogenetic distance, suggesting that the time factor alone does not explain divergences. our results are considerably useful for syntenic studies between supposedly remote species for the isolation of important genes for agronomy. \u00a9 2012 guyot et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the fermented dried seeds of theobroma cacao (cacao tree) are the main ingredient in chocolate. world cocoa production was estimated to be 3 million tons in 2010 with an annual estimated average growth rate of 2.2%. the cacao bean production industry is currently under threat from a rise in fungal diseases including black pod, frosty pod, and witches' broom. in order to address these issues, genome-sequencing efforts have been initiated recently to facilitate identification of genetic markers and genes that could be utilized to accelerate the release of robust t. cacao cultivars. however, problems inherent with assembly and resolution of distal regions of complex eukaryotic genomes, such as gaps, chimeric joins, and unresolvable repeat-induced compressions, have been unavoidably encountered with the sequencing strategies selected.results: here, we describe the construction of a bac-based integrated genetic-physical map of the t. cacao cultivar matina 1-6 which is designed to augment and enhance these sequencing efforts. three bac libraries, each comprised of 10\u00d7 coverage, were constructed and fingerprinted. 230 genetic markers from a high-resolution genetic recombination map and 96 arabidopsis-derived conserved ortholog set (cos) ii markers were anchored using pooled overgo hybridization. a dense tile path consisting of 29,383 bacs was selected and end-sequenced. the physical map consists of 154 contigs and 4,268 singletons. forty-nine contigs are genetically anchored and ordered to chromosomes for a total span of 307.2 mbp. the unanchored contigs (105) span 67.4 mbp and therefore the estimated genome size of t. cacao is 374.6 mbp. a comparative analysis with a. thaliana, v. vinifera, and p. trichocarpa suggests that comparisons of the genome assemblies of these distantly related species could provide insights into genome structure, evolutionary history, conservation of functional sites, and improvements in physical map assembly. a comparison between the two t. cacao cultivars matina 1-6 and criollo indicates a high degree of collinearity in their genomes, yet rearrangements were also observed.conclusions: the results presented in this study are a stand-alone resource for functional exploitation and enhancement of theobroma cacao but are also expected to complement and augment ongoing genome-sequencing efforts. this resource will serve as a template for refinement of the t. cacao genome through gap-filling, targeted re-sequencing, and resolution of repetitive dna arrays. \u00a9 2011 saski et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

(rosaceae) is an important companion species in central asia steppe. however, no information was so far detected about genetic diversity of this species. in recent years, effects of habitat fragmentation have become central issues in conservation genetics. in order to evaluate the genetic structure and to measure the effects of isolation caused by habitat fragmentation, the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) data were generated and analyzed from 110 samples collected from seven sites of local populations of p. acaulis distributed in northern china. eleven rapd primers produced a total of 61 unambiguous bands, of which 51 bands (83.6%) were polymorphic. a high level of genetic diversity was recognized within the populations of p. acaulis: 34.4 to 68.9% of polymorphic bands observed in the given population. analysis of molecular variance (amova) showed that, genetic variability was greater within populations (83.4%) than among populations within regions (12.0%) or among regions (4.6%) investigated in this study. in addition, a low degree of genetic differentiation (\u03a6 st= 0.17) was detected among all populations, which indicated that isolation had weak effects on genetic structure. the statistical analysis also revealed that, the genetic distances of p. acaulis among different populations were not significantly related with their geographic distances. therefore, p. acaulis should be treated as a separate species that needs more attention from a conservation point of view and it should be considered as a conservation strategy to increasing gene exchange among isolated populations. \u00a9 2011 academic journals.",

        "abstracttext": "background: circadian clocks provide an adaptive advantage through anticipation of daily and seasonal environmental changes. in plants, the central clock oscillator is regulated by several interlocking feedback loops. it was shown that a substantial proportion of the arabidopsis genome cycles with phases of peak expression covering the entire day. synchronized transcriptome cycling is driven through an extensive network of diurnal and clock-regulated transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory elements. study of the cycling transcriptome in other plant species could thus help elucidate the similarities and differences and identify hubs of regulation common to monocot and dicot plants. methodology/principal findings: using a combination of oligonucleotide microarrays and data mining pipelines, we examined daily rhythms in gene expression in one monocotyledonous and one dicotyledonous plant, rice and poplar, respectively. cycling transcriptomes were interrogated under different diurnal (driven) and circadian (free running) light and temperature conditions. collectively, photocycles and thermocycles regulated about 60% of the expressed nuclear genes in rice and poplar. depending on the condition tested, up to one third of oscillating arabidopsis-poplar-rice orthologs were phased within three hours of each other suggesting a high degree of conservation in terms of rhythmic gene expression. we identified clusters of rhythmically co-expressed genes and searched their promoter sequences to identify phase-specific cis-elements, including elements that were conserved in the promoters of arabidopsis, poplar, and rice. conclusions/significance: our results show that the cycling patterns of many circadian clock genes are highly conserved across poplar, rice, and arabidopsis. the expression of many orthologous genes in key metabolic and regulatory pathways is diurnal and/or circadian regulated and phased to similar times of day. our results confirm previous findings in arabidopsis of three major classes of cis-regulatory modules within the plant circadian network: the morning (me, gbox), evening (ee, gata), and midnight (pbx/tbx/sbx) modules. identification of identical overrepresented motifs in the promoters of cycling genes from different species suggests that the core diurnal/circadian cis-regulatory network is deeply conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous species. \u00a9 2011 filichkin et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the genetic regulation of flower color has been widely studied, notably as a character used by mendel and his predecessors in the study of inheritance in pea. methodology/principal findings: we used the genome sequence of model legumes, together with their known synteny to the pea genome to identify candidate genes for the a and a2 loci in pea. we then used a combination of genetic mapping, fast neutron mutant analysis, allelic diversity, transcript quantification and transient expression complementation studies to confirm the identity of the candidates. conclusions/significance: we have identified the pea genes a and a2. a is the factor determining anthocyanin pigmentation in pea that was used by gregor mendel 150 years ago in his study of inheritance. the a gene encodes a bhlh transcription factor. the white flowered mutant allele most likely used by mendel is a simple g to a transition in a splice donor site that leads to a mis-spliced mrna with a premature stop codon, and we have identified a second rare mutant allele. the a2 gene encodes a wd40 protein that is part of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory complex.",

        "abstracttext": "brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) is a model for the temperate grasses which include important cereals such as barley, wheat and oats. comparison of the brachypodium genome (accession bd21) with those of the model dicot arabidopsis thaliana and the tropical cereal rice (oryza sativa) provides an opportunity to compare and contrast genetic pathways controlling important traits. we analysed the homologies of genes controlling the induction of flowering using pathways curated in arabidopsis reactome as a starting point. pathways include those detecting and responding to the environmental cues of day length (photoperiod) and extended periods of low temperature (vernalization). variation in these responses has been selected during cereal domestication, providing an interesting comparison with the wild genome of brachypodium. brachypodium bd21 has well conserved homologues of circadian clock, photoperiod pathway and autonomous pathway genes defined in arabidopsis and homologues of vernalization pathway genes defined in cereals with the exception of vrn2 which was absent. bd21 also lacked a member of the co family (co3). in both cases flanking genes were conserved showing that these genes are deleted in at least this accession. segmental duplication explains the presence of two co-like genes in temperate cereals, of which one (hd1) is retained in rice, and explains many differences in gene family structure between grasses and arabidopsis. the conserved fine structure of duplications shows that they largely evolved to their present structure before the divergence of the rice and brachypodium. of four flowering-time genes found in rice but absent in arabidopsis, two were found in bd21 (id1, osmads51) and two were absent (ghd7, ehd1). overall, results suggest that an ancient core photoperiod pathway promoting flowering via the induction of ft has been modified by the recruitment of additional lineage specific pathways that promote or repress ft expression. \u00a9 2010 higgins et al.",

        "abstracttext": "background: peach [prunus persica (l.) batsch] is one of the most economically important fruit crops that, due to its genetic and biological characteristics (small genome size, taxonomic proximity to other important species and short juvenile period), has become a model plant in genomic studies of fruit trees. our aim was an in-depth study of the extent, distribution and structure of peach genetic variation in north american and european commercial varieties as well as old spanish varieties and several founders used in the early usa peach breeding programmes. for this we genotyped 224 peach cultivars using 50 ssrs evenly distributed along the 8 linkage groups of the prunus reference map.results: genetic distance analysis based on ssrs divided the peach cultivars in three main groups based mainly on their fruit characteristics: melting flesh peaches, melting flesh nectarines and non-melting varieties. whereas non-melting flesh peaches had a higher number of alleles than melting peaches and nectarines, they were more homozygous. with some exceptions ('admiral dewey', 'early crawford' and 'chinese cling'), the founder us cultivars clustered together with the commercial melting peaches, indicating that their germplasm is well represented in modern cultivars. population structure analysis showed a similar subdivision of the sample into subpopulations. linkage disequilibrium (ld) analysis in three unstructured, or barely structured, subpopulations revealed a high level of ld conservation in peach extending up to 13-15 cm.conclusions: using a much larger set of ssrs, our results confirm previous observations on peach variability and population structure and provide additional tools for breeding and breeders' rights enforcement. ssr data are also used for the estimation of marker mutation rates and allow pedigree inferences, particularly with founder genotypes of the currently grown cultivars, which are useful to understand the evolution of peach as a crop. results on ld conservation can be explained by the self-pollinating nature of peach cultivated germplasm and by a bottleneck that occurred at the beginning of modern breeding practices. high ld suggests that the development of whole-genome scanning approaches is suitable for genetic studies of agronomically important traits in peach. \u00a9 2010 aranzana et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "dna replication programs have been studied extensively in yeast and animal systems, where they have been shown to correlate with gene expression and certain epigenetic modifications. despite the conservation of core dna replication proteins, little is known about replication programs in plants. we used flow cytometry and tiling microarrays to profile dna replication of arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4 (chr4) during early, mid, and late s phase. replication profiles for early and mid s phase were similar and encompassed the majority of the euchromatin. late s phase exhibited a distinctly different profile that includes the remaining euchromatin and essentially all of the heterochromatin. termination zones were consistent between experiments, allowing us to define 163 putative replicons on chr4 that clustered into larger domains of predominately early or late replication. early-replicating sequences, especially the initiation zones of early replicons, displayed a pattern of epigenetic modifications specifying an open chromatin conformation. late replicons, and the termination zones of early replicons, showed an opposite pattern. histone h3 acetylated on lysine 56 (h3k56ac) was enriched in early replicons, as well as the initiation zones of both early and late replicons. h3k56ac was also associated with expressed genes, but this effect was local whereas replication time correlated with h3k56ac over broad regions. the similarity of the replication profiles for early and mid s phase cells indicates that replication origin activation in euchromatin is stochastic. replicon organization in arabidopsis is strongly influenced by epigenetic modifications to histones and dna. the domain organization of arabidopsis is more similar to that in drosophila than that in mammals, which may reflect genome size and complexity. the distinct patterns of association of h3k56ac with gene expression and early replication provide evidence that h3k56ac may be associated with initiation zones and replication origins. \u00a9 2010 lee et al.",

        "abstracttext": "despite the key role that pattern recognition receptors (prrs) play in regulating immunity in plants and animals, the mechanism of activation of the associated non-arginine-aspartate (non-rd) kinases is unknown. the rice prr xa21 recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, ax21 (activator of xa21-mediated immunity). here we show that the xa21 juxtamembrane (jm) domain is required for kinase autophosphorylation. threonine 705 in the xa21 jm domain is essential for xa21 autophosphorylation in vitro and xa21-mediated innate immunity in vivo. the replacement of thr705 by an alanine or glutamic acid abolishes xa21 autophosphorylation and eliminates interactions between xa21 and four xa21-binding proteins in yeast and rice. although threonine residues analogous to thr705 of xa21 are present in the jm domains of most rd and non-rd plant receptor-like kinases, this residue is not required for autophosphorylation of the arabidopsis rd rlk bri1 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1). the threonine 705 of xa21 is conserved only in the jm domains of plant rlks but not in those of fly, human, or mouse suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. these results contribute to growing knowledge regarding the mechanism by which non-rd rlks function in plant. \u00a9 2010 by the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology, inc.",

        "abstracttext": "ribosome-inactivating proteins (rips) are n-glycosidases that depurinate a specific adenine residue in the conserved sarcin/ricin loop of ribosomal rna. this modification renders the ribosome unable to bind the elongation factors, thereby inhibiting the protein synthesis. maize rip, a type iii rip, is unique compared to the other type i and type ii rips because it is synthesized as a precursor with a 25-residue internal inactivation region, which is removed in order to activate the protein. in this study, we describe the first solution structure of this type of rip, a \u00a028-kda active mutant of maize rip (mod). the overall protein structure of mod is comparable to those of the other type i rips and the a-chain of type ii rips but shows significant differences in specific regions, including (1) shorter \u03b26 and \u03b1b segments, probably for accommodating easier substrate binding, and (2) an \u03b1-helix instead of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet in the c-terminal domain, which has been reported to be involved in binding ribosomal protein p2 in some rips. furthermore, nmr chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that the p2 binding site on mod is located at the n-terminal domain near the internal inactivation region. this relocation of the p2 binding site can be rationalized by concerted changes in the electrostatic surface potential and 3d structures on the mod protein and provides vital clues about the underlying molecular mechanism of this unique type of rip. \u00a9 2009 elsevier ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background. in plants, expression of argonaute1 (ago1), the catalytic subunit of the rna-induced silencing complex responsible for post-transcriptional gene silencing, is controlled through a feedback loop involving the mir168 microrna. this complex auto-regulatory loop, composed of mir168-guided ago1-catalyzed cleavage of ago1 mrna and ago1-mediated stabilization of mir168, was shown to ensure the maintenance of ago1 homeostasis that is pivotal for the correct functioning of the mirna pathway. results. we applied different approaches to studying the genomic organization and the structural and functional evolution of mir168 homologs in brassicaeae. a whole genome comparison of arabidopsis and poplar, phylogenetic footprinting and phylogenetic reconstruction were used to date the duplication events originating mir168 homologs in these genomes. while orthology was lacking between arabidopsis and poplar mir168 genes, we successfully isolated orthologs of both loci present in arabidopsis (mir168a and mir168b) from all the brassicaceae species analyzed, including the basal species aethionema grandiflora, thus indicating that (1) independent duplication events took place in arabidopsis and poplar lineages and (2) the origin of mir168 paralogs predates both the brassicaceae radiation and the arabidopsis alpha polyploidization. different phylogenetic footprints, corresponding to known functionally relevant regions (transcription starting site and double-stranded structures responsible for microrna biogenesis and function) or for which functions could be proposed, were found to be highly conserved among mir168 homologs. comparative predictions of the identified micrornas also indicate extreme conservation of secondary structure and thermodynamic stability. conclusion. we used a comparative phylogenetic footprinting approach to identify the structural and functional constraints that shaped mir168 evolution in brassicaceae. although their duplication happened at least 40 million years ago, we found evidence that both mir168 paralogs have been maintained throughout the evolution of brassicaceae, most likely functionally as indicated by the extremely high conservation of functionally relevant regions, predicted secondary structure and thermodynamic profile. interestingly, the expression patterns observed in arabidopsis indicate that mir168b underwent partial subfunctionalization as determined by the experimental characterization of its expression pattern provided in this study. we found further evolutionary evidence that pre-mir168 lower stem (the rna-duplex structure adjacent to the mir-mir* stem) is significantly longer than animal lower stems and probably plays a relevant role in multi-step mir168 biogenesis. \u00a9 2009 gazzani et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: alternative splicing (as) is a widespread phenomenon in higher eukaryotes but the extent to which it leads to functional protein isoforms and to proteome expansion at large is still a matter of debate. in contrast to animal species, for which as has been studied extensively at the protein and functional level, protein-centered studies of as in plant species are scarce. here we investigate the functional impact of as in dicot and monocot plant species using a comparative approach. results: detailed comparison of as events in alternative spliced orthologs from the dicot arabidopsis thaliana and the monocot oryza sativa (rice) revealed that the vast majority of as events in both species do not result from functional conservation. transcript isoforms that are putative targets for the nonsense-mediated decay (nmd) pathway are as likely to contain conserved as events as isoforms that are translated into proteins. similar results were obtained when the same comparison was performed between the two more closely related monocot species rice and zea mays (maize). genome-wide computational analysis of functional protein domains encoded in alternatively and constitutively spliced genes revealed that only the rna recognition motif (rrm) is overrepresented in alternatively spliced genes in all species analyzed. in contrast, three domain types were overrepresented in constitutively spliced genes. as events were found to be less frequent within than outside predicted protein domains and no domain type was found to be enriched with as introns. analysis of as events that result in the removal of complete protein domains revealed that only a small number of domain types is spliced-out in all species analyzed. finally, in a substantial fraction of cases where a domain is completely removed, this domain appeared to be a unit of a tandem repeat. conclusion: the results from the ortholog comparisons suggest that the ability of a gene to produce more than one functional protein through as does not persist during evolution. cross-species comparison of the results of the protein-domain oriented analyses indicates little correspondence between the analyzed species. based on the premise that functional genetic features are most likely to be conserved during evolution, we conclude that as has only a limited role in functional expansion of the proteome in plants. \u00a9 2009 severing et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "internal compartmentalization of metals is an important metal tolerance mechanism in many organisms. in plants and fungi, sequestration into the vacuole is a major detoxificationmechanism for metals. cation transport into the vacuole can be mediated by cax (cation exchanger) transporters. the arabidopsis thaliana atcax2 transporter was shown previously to transport ca2+, cd2+ and mn2+. to assess the conservation of the functional and regulatory characteristics of cax2-like transporters in higher plants, we have characterized atcax2 orthologues from arabidopsis (atcax5), tomato (lecax2) and barley (hvcax2). substrate specificity and regulatory activity were assessed using a yeast heterologous-expression assay. each cax could transport ca2+ and mn2+ into the yeast vacuole, but they each had different cation transport kinetics. most notably, there was variation in the regulation of the transporters. as found with atcax2 previously, only expression of an n-terminally truncated form of atcax5 in yeast was able to mediate ca2+ and mn2+ transport, indicating that activity may be controlled by an autoregulatory region at the n-terminus. in contrast, either full-length or truncated lecax2 could efficiently transport ca2+, although mn2+ transport was controlled by the n-terminus. hvcax2 did not appear to possess an n-terminal regulatory domain. expression of atcax2 was not significantly modulated by metal stress; however, atcax5 and hvcax2 were transcriptionally up-regulated by high mn2+ treatment, and by ca2+ and na+ stress respectively. it is therefore apparent that, despite the high sequence identity between plant cax2 orthologues, there is significant diversity in their functional characteristics, particularly with regard to regulatory mechanisms. \u00a9 the authors journal compilation \u00a9 2009 biochemial society.",

        "abstracttext": "background. plant genomes contain a high proportion of duplicated genes as a result of numerous whole, segmental and local duplications. these duplications lead up to the formation of gene families, which are the usual material for many evolutionary studies. however, all characterized genomes include single-copy (unique) genes that have not received much attention. unlike gene duplication, gene loss is not an unspecific mechanism but is rather influenced by a functional selection. in this context, we have established and used stringent criteria in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present in plant proteomes. comparisons of unique genes in the green phylum were used to characterize the gene and protein features exhibited by both conserved and species-specific unique genes. results. we identified the unique genes within both a. thaliana and o. sativa genomes and classified them according to the number of homologs in the alternative species: none (u{1:0}), one (u{1:1}) or several (u{1:m}). regardless of the species, all the genes in these groups present some conserved characteristics, such as small average protein size and abnormal intron number. in order to understand the origin and function of unique genes, we further characterized the u{1:1} gene pairs. the possible involvement of sequence convergence in the creation of u{1:1} pairs was discarded due to the frequent conservation of intron positions. furthermore, an orthology relationship between the two members of each u{1:1} pair was strongly supported by a high conservation in the protein sizes and transcription levels. within the promoter of the unique conserved genes, we found a number of tata and telo boxes that specifically differed from their mean number in the whole genome. many unique genes have been conserved as unique through evolution from the green alga ostreococcus lucimarinus to higher plants. plant unique genes may also have homologs in bacteria and we showed a link between the targeting towards plastids of proteins encoded by plant nuclear unique genes and their homology with a bacterial protein. conclusion. many of the a. thaliana and o. sativa unique genes are conserved in plants for which the ancestor diverged at least 725 million years ago (mya). half of these genes are also present in other eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic species. thus, our results indicate that (i) a strong negative selection pressure has conserved a number of genes as unique in genomes throughout evolution, (ii) most unique genes are subjected to a low divergence rate, (iii) they have some features observed in housekeeping genes but for most of them there is no functional annotation and (iv) they may have an ancient origin involving a possible gene transfer from ancestral chloroplasts or bacteria to the plant nucleus. \u00a9 2008 armis\u00e9n et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad54 gene has critical roles in dna double-strand break repair, homologous recombination, and gene targeting. previous results show that the yeast gene enhances gene targeting when expressed in arabidopsis thaliana. in this work we address the trans-species compatibility of rad54 functions. we show that overexpression of yeast rad54 in arabidopsis enhances dna damage resistance severalfold. thus, the yeast gene is active in the arabidopsis homologous-recombination repair system. moreover, we have identified an a. thaliana ortholog of yeast rad54, named atrad54. this gene, with close sequence similarity to rad54, complements methylmethane sulfonate (mms) sensitivity but not uv sensitivity or gene targeting defects of rad54d mutant yeast cells. overexpression of atrad54 in arabidopsis leads to enhanced resistance to dna damage. this gene's assignment as a rad54 ortholog is further supported by the interaction of atrad54 with atrad51 and the interactions between alien proteins (i.e., yeast rad54 with atrad51 and yeast rad51 with atrad54) in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. these interactions hint at the molecular nature of this interkingdom complementation, although the stronger effect of the yeast rad54 in plants than atrad54 in yeast might be explained by an ability of the rad54 protein to act alone, independently of its interaction with rad51. copyright \u00a9 2008 by the genetics society of america.",

        "abstracttext": "background: barley has one of the largest and most complex genomes of all economically important food crops. the rise of new short read sequencing technologies such as illumina/solexa permits such large genomes to be effectively sampled at relatively low cost. based on the corresponding sequence reads a mathematically defined repeat (mdr) index can be generated to map repetitive regions in genomic sequences. results: we have generated 574 mbp of illumina/solexa sequences from barley total genomic dna, representing about 10% of a genome equivalent. from these sequences we generated an mdr index which was then used to identify and mark repetitive regions in the barley genome. comparison of the mdr plots with expert repeat annotation drawing on the information already available for known repetitive elements revealed a significant correspondence between the two methods. mdr-based annotation allowed for the identification of dozens of novel repeat sequences, though, which were not recognised by hand-annotation. the mdr data was also used to identify gene-containing regions by masking of repetitive sequences in eight de-novo sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) clones. for half of the identified candidate gene islands indeed gene sequences could be identified. mdr data were only of limited use, when mapped on genomic sequences from the closely related species triticum monococcum as only a fraction of the repetitive sequences was recognised. conclusion: an mdr index for barley, which was obtained by whole-genome illumina/solexa sequencing, proved as efficient in repeat identification as manual expert annotation. circumventing the labour-intensive step of producing a specific repeat library for expert annotation, an mdr index provides an elegant and efficient resource for the identification of repetitive and low-copy (i.e. potentially gene-containing sequences) regions in uncharacterised genomic sequences. the restriction that a particular mdr index can not be used across species is outweighed by the low costs of illumina/solexa sequencing which makes any chosen genome accessible for whole-genome sequence sampling. \u00a9 2008 wicker et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "in plants there are several classes of 21-24-nt short rnas that regulate gene expression. the most conserved class is the micrornas (mirnas), although some mirnas are found only in specific species. we used high-throughput pyrosequencing to identify conserved and nonconserved mirnas and other short rnas in tomato fruit and leaf. several conserved mirnas showed tissue-specific expression, which, combined with target gene validation results, suggests that mirnas may play a role in fleshy fruit development. we also identified four new nonconserved mirnas. one of the validated targets of a novel mirna is a member of the ctr family involved in fruit ripening. however, 62 predicted targets showing near perfect complementarity to potential new mirnas did not validate experimentally. this suggests that target prediction of plant short rnas could have a high false-positive rate and must therefore be validated experimentally. we also found short rnas from a solanaceae-specific foldback transposon, which showed a mirna/mirna*-like distribution, suggesting that this element may function as a mirna gene progenitor. the other solanaceae-specific class of short rna was derived from an endogenous pararetrovirus sequence inserted into the tomato chromosomes. this study opens a new avenue in the field of fleshy fruit biology by raising the possibility that fruit development and ripening may be under mirna regulation. \u00a92008 by cold spring harbor laboratory press.",

        "abstracttext": "background: long terminal repeat retrotransposons (ltr elements) are ubiquitous eukaryotic tes that transpose through rna intermediates. accounting for significant proportion of many plant genomes, ltr elements have been well established as one of the major forces underlying the evolution of plant genome size, structure and function. the accessibility of more than 40% of genomic sequences of the model legume medicago truncatula (mt) has made the comprehensive study of its ltr elements possible. results: we use a newly developed tool ltr_finder to identify ltr retrotransposons in the mt genome and detect 526 full-length elements as well as a great number of copies related to them. these elements constitute about 9.6% of currently available genomic sequences. they are classified into 85 families of which 64 are reported for the first time. the majority of the ltr retrotransposons belong to either copia or gypsy superfamily and the others are categorized as trims or lards by their length. we find that the copy-number of copia-like families is 3 times more than that of gypsy-like ones but the latter contribute more to the genome. the analysis of pbs and protein-coding domain structure of the ltr families reveals that they tend to use only 4-5 types of trnas and many families have quite conservative orfs besides known te domains. for several important families, we describe in detail their abundance, conservation, insertion time and structure. we investigate the amplification-deletion pattern of the elements and find that the detectable full-length elements are relatively young and most of them were inserted within the last 0.52 my. we also estimate that more than ten million bp of the mt genomic sequences have been removed by the deletion of ltr elements and the removal of the full-length structures in mt has been more rapid than in rice. conclusion: this report is the first comprehensive description and analysis of ltr retrotransposons in the mt genome. many important novel ltr families were discovered and their evolution is elucidated. our results may outline the ltr retrotransposon landscape of the model legume. \u00a9 2008 wang and liu; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the development of genetic markers is complex and costly in species with little pre-existing genomic information. faba bean possesses one of the largest and least studied genomes among cultivated crop plants and no gene-based genetic maps exist. gene-based orthologous markers allow chromosomal regions and levels of synteny to be characterised between species, reveal phylogenetic relationships and chromosomal evolution, and enable targeted identification of markers for crop breeding. in this study orthologous codominant cross-species markers have been deployed to produce the first exclusively gene-based genetic linkage map of faba bean (vicia faba), using an f6 population developed from a cross between the lines vf6 (equina type) and vf27 (paucijuga type). results: of 796 intron-targeted amplified polymorphic (itap) markers screened, 151 markers could be used to construct a comparative genetic map. linkage analysis revealed seven major and five small linkage groups (lgs), one pair and 12 unlinked markers. each lg was comprised of three to 30 markers and varied in length from 23.6 cm to 324.8 cm. the map spanned a total length of 1685.8 cm. a simple and direct macrosyntenic relationship between faba bean and medicago truncatula was evident, while faba bean and lentil shared a common rearrangement relative to m. truncatula. one hundred and four of the 127 mapped markers in the 12 lgs, which were previously assigned to m. truncatula genetic and physical maps, were found in regions syntenic between the faba bean and m. truncatula genomes. however chromosomal rearrangements were observed that could explain the difference in chromosome numbers between these three legume species. these rearrangements suggested high conservation of m. truncatula chromosomes 1, 5 and 8; moderate conservation of chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 7 and no conservation with m. truncatula chromosome 6. multiple pcr amplicons and comparative mapping were suggestive of small-scale duplication events in faba bean. this study also provides a preliminary indication for finer scale macrosynteny between m. truncatula, lentil and faba bean. markers originally designed from genes on the same m. truncatula bacs were found to be grouped together in corresponding syntenic areas in lentil and faba bean. conclusion: despite the large size of the faba bean genome, comparative mapping did not reveal evidence for polyploidisation, segmental duplication, or significant rearrangements compared to m. truncatula, although a bias in the use of single locus markers may have limited the detection of duplications. non-coding repetitive dna or transposable element content provides a possible explanation for the difference in genome sizes. similar patterns of rearrangements in faba bean and lentil compared to m. truncatula support phylogenetic studies dividing these species into the tribes viceae and trifoliae. however, substantial macrosynteny was apparent between faba bean and m. truncatula, with the exception of chromosome 6 where no orthologous markers were found, confirming previous investigations suggesting chromosome 6 is atypical. the composite map, anchored with orthologous markers mapped in m. truncatula, provides a central reference map for future use of genomic and genetic information in faba bean genetic analysis and breeding. \u00a9 2008 ellwood et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "terpene synthases are responsible for the large diversity of terpene carbon skeletons found in plants. the unique, carbocationic reaction mechanism of these enzymes can form multiple products from a single prenyl diphosphate substrate. two maize genes were isolated that encode very similar sesquiterpene synthases, tps6 and tps11, which both produce \u03b2-bisabolene, a common monocyclic sesquiterpene, and \u03b2-macrocarpene, an uncommon bicyclic olefin. investigation of the reaction mechanism showed that the formation of \u03b2-macrocarpene proceeds via a neutral \u03b2-bisabolene intermediate and requires reprotonation by a proton that may ultimately be abstracted from water. this reprotonation is dependent on the ph and the presence of a mg2+ cofactor. mutational analysis of the enzyme demonstrated that a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the active center of the enzymes is important for the protonation process. tps6 and tps11 are transcribed both in leaves and roots of maize, but the respective terpene products were only detected in roots. the expression in roots was up-regulated by herbivore damage to the leaves, suggesting a long distance signal transduction cascade between leaves and roots. \u00a9 2008 by the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology, inc.",

        "abstracttext": "background: diversity estimates in cultivated plants provide a rationale for conservation strategies and support the selection of starting material for breeding programs. diversity measures applied to crops usually have been limited to the assessment of genome polymorphism at the dna level. occasionally, selected morphological features are recorded and the content of key chemical constituents determined, but unbiased and comprehensive chemical phenotypes have not been included systematically in diversity surveys. our objective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by nontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between metabolic and genome diversity in this crop. results: ten sesame accessions were selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in india, western asia, sudan and venezuela based on previous aflp studies. ethanolic seed extracts were separated by hplc, metabolites were ionized by positive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass spectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000. genome diversity was determined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) using eight primer pair combinations. the relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at the metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate statistics. conclusion: patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic levels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the evolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. this result implies that when used for the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity assessment based on neutral dna markers should be complemented with metabolic profiles. we hypothesize that this applies to all crops with a long history of domestication that possess commercially relevant traits affected by chemical phenotypes. \u00a9 2008 laurentin et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: wrky proteins belong to the wrky-gcm1 superfamily of zinc finger transcription factors that have been subject to a large plant-specific diversification. for the cereal crop barley (hordeum vulgare), three different wrky proteins have been characterized so far as regulators in sucrose signaling, pathogen defense, and in response to cold and drought. however, their phylogenetic relationship remained unresolved. results: in this study, we used available sequence information to identify a minimum number of 45 barley wrky transcription factor (hvwrky) genes. according to their structural features, the hvwrky factors were classified into the previously defined polyphyletic wrky subgroups 1 to 3. furthermore, we could assign putative orthologs of the hvwrky proteins in arabidopsis and rice. while in most cases clades of orthologous proteins were formed within each group or subgroup, other clades were composed of paralogous proteins for the grasses and arabidopsis only, which is indicative of specific gene radiation events. to gain insight into their putative functions, we examined expression profiles of wrky genes from publicly available microarray data resources and found group specific expression patterns. while putative orthologs of the hvwrky transcription factors have been inferred from phylogenetic sequence analysis, we performed a comparative expression analysis of wrky genes in arabidopsis and barley. indeed, highly correlative expression profiles were found between some of the putative orthologs. conclusion: hvwrky genes have not only undergone radiation in monocot or dicot species, but exhibit evolutionary traits specific to grasses. hvwrky proteins exhibited not only sequence similarities between orthologs with arabidopsis, but also relatedness in their expression patterns. this correlative expression is indicative for a putative conserved function of related wrky proteins in monocot and dicot species. \u00a9 2008 mangelsen et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

(2n = 2x = 14) and t. micranthum viv. (2n = 2x = 16), two diploid species of similar geographic distribution. t. dubium has two nuclear its sequences that closely match those of t. campestre and t. micranthum. genomic in situ hybridisation using genomic dna of t. campestre and t. micranthum as probes has differentiated the ancestral sets of chromosomes in t. dubium cells. comparative fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of 5s and 18s-26s rdna loci were also consistent with an allotetraploid structure of the t. dubium genome. a marked preponderance of its repeats from t. campestre over those from t. micranthum indicated that concerted evolution has resulted in partial homogenisation of these sequences by depletion of the t. micranthum-derived 18s-26s rdna repeats. in parallel with this, the epigenetic phenomenon of nucleolar dominance has been observed in t. dubium such that the chromatin associated with the 18s-26s rdna loci derived from t. campestre is decondensed (transcriptionally active), whilst that from t. micranthum remains highly condensed throughout the cell cycle. t. dubium, therefore, appears to have arisen by way of hybridisation between forms of the diploid species t. campestre and t. micranthum accompanied by chromosome doubling. the observed genomic changes in rdna resulting from interspecific hybridisation provide evidence for the process of genome diploidisation in t. dubium. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2007.",

        "abstracttext": "background: motif finding algorithms have developed in their ability to use computationally efficient methods to detect patterns in biological sequences. however the posterior classification of the output still suffers from some limitations, which makes it difficult to assess the biological significance of the motifs found. previous work has highlighted the existence of positional bias of motifs in the dna sequences, which might indicate not only that the pattern is important, but also provide hints of the positions where these patterns occur preferentially. results: we propose to integrate position uniformity tests and over-representation tests to improve the accuracy of the classification of motifs. using artificial data, we have compared three different statistical tests (chi-square, kolmogorov-smirnov and a chi-square bootstrap) to assess whether a given motif occurs uniformly in the promoter region of a gene. using the test that performed better in this dataset, we proceeded to study the positional distribution of several well known cis-regulatory elements, in the promoter sequences of different organisms (s. cerevisiae, h. sapiens, d. melanogaster, e. coli and several dicotyledons plants). the results show that position conservation is relevant for the transcriptional machinery. conclusion: we conclude that many biologically relevant motifs appear heterogeneously distributed in the promoter region of genes, and therefore, that non-uniformity is a good indicator of biological relevance and can be used to complement over-representation tests commonly used. in this article we present the results obtained for the s. cerevisiae data sets. \u00a9 2008 casimiro et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the maize hm1 gene provides protection against a lethal leaf blight and ear mold disease caused by cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (ccr1). although it was the first disease-resistance (dr) gene to be cloned, it remains a novelty because, instead of participating in the plant recognition and response system as most dr genes do, hm1 disarms the pathogen directly. it does so by encoding an nadph-dependent reductase, whose function is to inactivate helminthosporium carbonum (hc) toxin, an epoxide-containing cyclic tetrapeptide, which the pathogen produces as a key virulence factor to colonize maize. although ccr1 is strictly a pathogen of maize, orthologs of hm1 and the hc-toxin reductase activity are present in the grass family, suggesting an ancient and evolutionarily conserved role of this dr trait in plants. here, we provide proof for such a role by demonstrating its involvement in nonhost resistance of barley to ccr1. barley leaves in which expression of the hm1 homologue was silenced became susceptible to infection by ccr1, but only if the pathogen was able to produce hc toxin. phylogenetic analysis indicated that hm1 evolved exclusively and early in the grass lineage. given the devastating ability of ccr1 to kill maize, these findings imply that the evolution and/or geographical distribution of grasses may have been constrained if hm1 did not emerge. \u00a9 2008 by the national academy of sciences of the usa.",

        "abstracttext": "background: musa species (zingiberaceae, zingiberales) including bananas and plantains are collectively the fourth most important crop in developing countries. knowledge concerning musa genome structure and the origin of distinct cultivars has greatly increased over the last few years. until now, however, no large-scale analyses of musa genomic sequence have been conducted. this study compares genomic sequence in two musa species with orthologous regions in the rice genome. results: we produced 1.4 mb of musa sequence from 13 bac clones, annotated and analyzed them along with 4 previously sequenced bacs. the 443 predicted genes revealed that zingiberales genes share gc content and distribution characteristics with eudicot and poaceae genomes. comparison with rice revealed microsynteny regions that have persisted since the divergence of the commelinid orders poales and zingiberales at least 117 mya. the previously hypothesized large-scale duplication event in the common ancestor of major cereal lineages within the poaceae was verified. the divergence time distributions for musa-zingiber (zingiberaceae, zingiberales) orthologs and paralogs provide strong evidence for a large-scale duplication event in the musa lineage after its divergence from the zingiberaceae approximately 61 mya. comparisons of genomic regions from m. acuminata and m. balbisiana revealed highly conserved genome structure, and indicated that these genomes diverged circa 4.6 mya. conclusion: these results point to the utility of comparative analyses between distantly-related monocot species such as rice and musa for improving our understanding of monocot genome evolution. sequencing the genome of m. acuminata would provide a strong foundation for comparative genomics in the monocots. in addition a genome sequence would aid genomic and genetic analyses of cultivated musa polyploid genotypes in research aimed at localizing and cloning genes controlling important agronomic traits for breeding purposes. \u00a9 2008 lescot et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: recent studies using high-throughput methods have revealed that transposable elements (tes) are a comprehensive target for dna methylation. however, the relationship between tes and their genomic environment regarding methylation still remains unclear. the rice genome contains representatives of all known te families with different characteristics of chromosomal distribution, structure, transposition, size, and copy number. here we studied the dna methylation state around 12 tes in nine genomic dnas from cultivated rice strains and their closely related wild strains. results: we employed a transposon display (td) method to analyze the methylation environments in the genomes. the 12 te families, consisting of four class i elements, seven class ii elements, and one element of a different class, were differentially distributed in the rice chromosomes: some elements were concentrated in the centromeric or pericentromeric regions, but others were located in euchromatic regions. the td analyses revealed that the te families were embedded in flanking sequences with different methylation degrees. each te had flanking sequences with similar degrees of methylation among the nine rice strains. the class i elements tended to be present in highly methylated regions, while those of the class ii elements showed widely varying degrees of methylation. in some te families, the degrees of methylation were markedly lower than the average methylation state of the genome. in two families, dramatic changes of the methylation state occurred depending on the distance from the te. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the te families in the rice genomes can be characterized by the methylation states of their surroundings. the copy number and degree of conservation of the te family are not likely to be correlated with the degree of methylation. we discuss possible relationships between the methylation state of tes and their surroundings. this is the first report demonstrating that tes in the genome are associated with a particular methylation environment that is a feature of a given te. \u00a9 2007 takata et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the genetic system of chloroplasts, including the machinery for transcription, translation, and dna replication, exhibits substantial similarity to that of eubacteria. chloroplasts are also thought to possess a system for generating guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate ((p)ppgpp), which triggers the stringent response in eubacteria, with genes encoding chloroplastic (p)ppgpp synthetase having been identified. we now describe the identification and characterization of genes (oscrsh1, oscrsh2, and oscrsh3) for a novel type of (p)ppgpp synthetase in rice. the proteins encoded by these genes contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide at the nh2 terminus, a central rela-spot-like domain, and two ef-hand motifs at the cooh terminus. the recombinant oscrsh1 protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro, and genetic complementation analysis revealed that expression of oscrsh1 suppressed the phenotype of an escherichia coli mutant deficient in the rela and spot enzymes. biochemical analysis showed that the oscrsh proteins possess (p)ppgpp synthetase activity that is dependent both on ca2+ and on the ef-hand motifs. a data base search identified a crsh homolog in the dicotyledon arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that such genes are conserved among both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous land plants. crsh proteins thus likely function as ca 2+-activated (p)ppgpp synthetases in plant chloroplasts, implicating both ca2+ and (p)ppgpp signaling in regulation of the genetic system of these organelles. \u00a9 2007 by the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology, inc.",

        "abstracttext": "there are thousands of maize mutants, which are invaluable resources for plant research. geneticists use them to study underlying mechanisms of biochemistry, cell biology, cell development, and cell physiology. to streamline the understanding of such complex processes, researchers need the most current versions of genetic and physical maps, tools with the ability to recognize novel phenotypes or classify known phenotypes, and an intimate knowledge of the biochemical processes generating physiological and phenotypic effects. they must also know how all of these factors change and differ among species, diverse alleles, germplasms, and environmental conditions. while there are robust databases, such as maizegdb, for some of these types of raw data, other crucial components are missing. moreover, the management of visually observed mutant phenotypes is still in its infant stage, let alone the complex query methods that can draw upon high-level and aggregated information to answer the questions of geneticists. in this paper, we address the scientific challenge and propose to develop a robust framework for managing the knowledge of visually observed phenotypes, mining the correlation of visual characteristics with genetic maps, and discovering the knowledge relating to cross-species conservation of visual and genetic patterns. the ultimate goal of this research is to allow a geneticist to submit phenotypic and genomic information on a mutant to a knowledge base and ask, \"what genes or environmental factors cause this visually observed phenotype?\". \u00a9 2007 imperial college press.",

        "abstracttext": "background: extraordinary size variation of higher plant nuclear genomes is in large part caused by differences in accumulation of repetitive dna. this makes repetitive dna of great interest for studying the molecular mechanisms shaping architecture and function of complex plant genomes. however, due to methodological constraints of conventional cloning and sequencing, a global description of repeat composition is available for only a very limited number of higher plants. in order to provide further data required for investigating evolutionary patterns of repeated dna within and between species, we used a novel approach based on massive parallel sequencing which allowed a comprehensive repeat characterization in our model species, garden pea (pisum sativum). results: analysis of 33.3 mb sequence data resulted in quantification and partial sequence reconstruction of major repeat families occurring in the pea genome with at least thousands of copies. our results showed that the pea genome is dominated by ltr-retrotransposons, estimated at 140,000 copies/1c. ty3/gypsy elements are less diverse and accumulated to higher copy numbers than ty1/copia. this is in part due to a large population of ogre-like retrotransposons which alone make up over 20% of the genome. in addition to numerous types of mobile elements, we have discovered a set of novel satellite repeats and two additional variants of telomeric sequences. comparative genome analysis revealed that there are only a few repeat sequences conserved between pea and soybean genomes. on the other hand, all major families of pea mobile elements are well represented in m. truncatula. conclusion: we have demonstrated that even in a species with a relatively large genome like pea, where a single 454-sequencing run provided only 0.77% coverage, the generated sequences were sufficient to reconstruct and analyze major repeat families corresponding to a total of 35-48% of the genome. these data provide a starting point for further investigations of legume plant genomes based on their global comparative analysis and for the development of more sophisticated approaches for data mining. \u00a9 2007 macas et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the myb-related gene asymmetric leaves 1 (as1) and its orthologs have an evolutionarily conserved role in specification of leaf cell identity. as1 is expressed in leaf founder cells, where it functions as a heterodimer with the structurally unrelated as2 proteins to repress activity of knotted 1-like homeobox (knox) genes. as1 therefore confines knox activity to the shoot apical meristem, where it promotes stem cell function through the regulation of phytohormone activities. here, we show that loss-of-function mutations in as1 unexpectedly convey heightened protection against necrotrophic fungi. as1 operates as a negative regulator of inducible resistance against these pathogens by selectively binding to the promoters of genes controlled by the immune activator, jasmonic acid (ja), damping the defense response. in contrast, as1 is a positive regulator of salicylic acid (sa)-independent extracellular defenses against bacterial pathogens. neither the absence of as2 nor erecta function, which enhances the morphological phenotype of as1, nor the conditional or constitutive expression of knox genes impacted disease resistance. thus, the function of as1 in responses to phytopathogens is independent of its as2-associated role in development. loss of function in the as1 orthologs phan in antirrhinum majus and nsphan in nicotiana sylvestris produced pathogen-response phenotypes similar to as1 plants, and therefore the defense function of as1 is evolutionarily conserved in plant species with a divergence time of \u2248125 million years. \u00a9 2007 by the national academy of sciences of the usa.",

        "abstracttext": "background: plant hybrid proline-rich proteins (hyprps) are putative cell wall proteins consisting, usually, of a repetitive proline-rich (pr) n-terminal domain and a conserved eight-cysteine motif (8 cm) c-terminal domain. understanding the evolutionary dynamics of hyprps might provide not only insight into their so far elusive function, but also a model for other large protein families in plants. results: we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of hyprps from seven plant species, including representatives of gymnosperms and both monocot and dicot angiosperms. every species studied possesses a large family of 14-52 hyprps. angiosperm hyprps exhibit signs of recent major diversification involving, at least in arabidopsis and rice, several independent tandem gene multiplications. a distinct subfamily of relatively well-conserved c-type hyprps, often with long hydrophobic pr domains, has been identified. in most of gymnosperm (pine) hyprps, diversity appears within the c-type group while angiosperms have only a few of well-conserved c-type representatives. atypical (glycine-rich or extremely short) n-terminal domains apparently evolved independently in multiple lineages of the hyprp family, possibly via inversion or loss of sequences encoding proline-rich domains. expression profiles of potato and arabidopsis hyprp genes exhibit instances of both overlapping and complementary organ distribution. the diversified non-c-type hyprp genes from recently amplified chromosomal clusters in arabidopsis often share their specialized expression profiles. c-type genes have broader expression patterns in both species (potato and arabidopsis), although orthologous genes exhibit some differences. conclusion: hyprps represent a dynamically evolving protein family apparently unique to seed plants. we suggest that ancestral hyprps with long proline-rich domains produced the current diversity through ongoing gene duplications accompanied by shortening, modification or loss of the proline-rich domains. most of the diversity in gymnosperms and angiosperms originates from different branches of the hyprp family. rapid sequence diversification is consistent with only limited requirements for structure conservation and, together with high variability of gene expression patterns, limits the interpretation of any functional study focused on a single hyprp gene or a couple of hyprp genes in single plant species. \u00a9 2007 dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: various methods have been developed to explore inter-genomic relationships among plant species. here, we present a sequence similarity analysis based upon comparison of transcript-assembly and methylation-filtered databases from five plant species and physically anchored rice coding sequences. results: a comparison of the frequency of sequence alignments, determined by megablast, between rice coding sequences in tigr pseudomolecules and annotations vs 4.0 and comprehensive transcript-assembly and methylation-filtered databases from lolium perenne (ryegrass), zea mays (maize), hordeum vulgare (barley), glycine max (soybean) and arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) was undertaken. each rice pseudomolecule was divided into 10 segments, each containing 10% of the functionally annotated, expressed genes. this indicated a correlation between relative segment position in the rice genome and numbers of alignments with all the queried monocot and dicot plant databases. colour-coded moving windows of 100 functionally annotated, expressed genes along each pseudomolecule were used to generate 'heat-maps'. these revealed consistent intra- and inter-pseudomolecule variation in the relative concentrations of significant alignments with the tested plant databases. analysis of the annotations and derived putative expression patterns of rice genes from 'hot-spots' and 'cold-spots' within the heat maps indicated possible functional differences. a similar comparison relating to ancestral duplications of the rice genome indicated that duplications were often associated with 'hot-spots'. conclusion: physical positions of expressed genes in the rice genome are correlated with the degree of conservation of similar sequences in the transcriptomes of other plant species. this relative conservation is associated with the distribution of different sized gene families and segmentally duplicated loci and may have functional and evolutionary implications. \u00a9 2007 armstead et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "application of glyphosate (n-[phosphonomethyl] glycine) to bradyrhizobium sp. (lupinus)-nodulated lupin plants caused modifications in the protein pattern of bacteroids. the most significant change was the presence of a 44-kda polypeptide in bacteroids from plants treated with the higher doses of glyphosate employed (5 and 10 mm). the polypeptide has been characterized by the amino acid sequencing of its n terminus and the isolation and nucleic acid sequencing of its encoding gene. it is putatively encoded by a single gene, and the protein has been identified as a putative porin. protein modeling revealed the existence of several domains sharing similarity to different porins, such as a transmembrane beta-barrel. the protein has been designated blpp, for bradyrhizobium sp. (lupinus) putative porin, and would be the first porin described in bradyrhizobium sp. (lupinus). in addition, a putative conserved domain of porins has been identified which consists of 87 amino acids, located in the blpp sequence 30 amino acids downstream of the n-terminal region. in bacteroids, mrna of the blpp gene shows a basal constitutive expression that increases under glyphosate treatment, and the expression of the gene is seemingly regulated at the transcriptional level. by contrast, in free-living bacteria glyphosate treatment leads to an inhibition of blpp mrna accumulation, indicating a different effect of glyphosate on blpp gene expression in bacteroids and free-living bacteria. the possible role of blpp in a metabolite interchange between bradyrhizobium and lupin is discussed. copyright \u00a9 2007, american society for microbiology. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "background: synaptotagmin genes are found in animal genomes and are known to function in the nervous system. genes with a similar domain architecture as well as sequence similarity to synaptotagmin c2 domains have also been found in plant genomes. the plant genes share an additional region of sequence similarity with a group of animal genes named fam62. fam62 genes also have a similar domain architecture. little is known about the functions of the plant genes and animal fam62 genes. indeed, many members of the large and diverse syt gene family await functional characterization. understanding the evolutionary relationships among these genes will help to realize the full implications of functional studies and lead to improved genome annotation. results: i collected and compared plant syt-like sequences from the primary nucleotide sequence databases at ncbi. the collection comprises six groups of plant genes conserved in embryophytes: ntmc2type1 to ntmc2type6. i collected and compared metazoan fam62 sequences and identified some similar sequences from other eukaryotic lineages. i found evidence of rna editing and alternative splicing. i compared the intron patterns of syt genes. i also compared rabphilin and doc2 genes. conclusion: genes encoding proteins with n-terminal-transmembrane-c2 domain architectures resembling synaptotagmins, are widespread in eukaryotes. a collection of these genes is presented here. the collection provides a resource for studies of intron evolution. i have classified the collection into homologous gene families according to distinctive patterns of sequence conservation and intron position. the evolutionary histories of these gene families are traceable through the appearance of family members in different eukaryotic lineages. assuming an intron-rich eukaryotic ancestor, the conserved intron patterns distinctive of individual gene families, indicate independent origins of syt, fam62 and ntmc2 genes. resemblances among these large, multi-domain proteins are due not only to shared ancestry (homology) but also to convergent evolution (analogy). during the evolution of these gene families, duplications and other gene rearrangements affecting domain composition, have occurred along with sequence divergence, leading to complex family relationships with accordingly complex functional implications. the functional homologies and analogies among these genes remain to be established empirically. \u00a9 2007 craxton; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: upstream open reading frames (uorfs) can mediate translational control over the largest, or major orf (morf) in response to starvation, polyamine concentrations, and sucrose concentrations. one plant uorf with conserved peptide sequences has been shown to exert this control in an amino acid sequence-dependent manner but generally it is not clear what kinds of genes are regulated, or how extensively this mechanism is invoked in a given genome. results: by comparing full-length cdna sequences from arabidopsis and rice we identified 26 distinct homology groups of conserved peptide uorfs, only three of which have been reported previously. pairwise ka/ks analysis showed that purifying selection had acted on nearly all conserved peptide uorfs and their associated morfs. functions of predicted morf proteins could be inferred for 16 homology groups and many of these proteins appear to have a regulatory function, including 6 transcription factors, 5 signal transduction factors, 3 developmental signal molecules, a homolog of translation initiation factor eif5, and a ring finger protein. transcription factors are clearly overrepresented in this data set when compared to the frequency calculated for the entire genome (p = 1.2 \u00d7 10-7). duplicate gene pairs arising from a whole genome duplication (ohnologs) with a conserved uorf are much more likely to have been retained in arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) than are ohnologs of other genes (39% vs 14% of ancestral genes, p = 5 \u00d7 10-3). two uorf groups were found in animals, indicating an ancient origin of these putative regulatory elements. conclusion: conservation of uorf amino acid sequence, association with homologous morfs over long evolutionary time periods, preferential retention after whole genome duplications, and preferential association with morfs coding for transcription factors suggest that the conserved peptide uorfs identified in this study are strong candidates for translational controllers of regulatory genes. \u00a9 2007 hayden and jorgensen; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "although copia retrotransposons are major components of all plant genomes, the evolutionary relationships between individual copia families and between elements from different plant species are only poorly studied. we used 20 copia families from the large-genome plants barley and wheat to identify 46 families of homologous copia elements from rice and 22 from arabidopsis, two plant species with much smaller genomes. in total, 599 copia elements were analyzed. phylogenetic analysis showed that copia elements from the four species can be classified into six ancient lineages that existed before the divergence of monocots and dicots. the six lineages show a surprising degree of conservation in sequence organization and other characteristics across species. additionally, the phylogenetic data suggest at least one case of horizontal gene transfer between the arabidopsis and rice lineages. insertion time estimates for 522 high-copy elements showed that retrotransposons from rice were active at different times in waves of activity lasting 0.5-2 million years, depending on the family, whereas elements from wheat and barley had longer periods of activity. we estimated that half of the rice copia elements are truncated or otherwise rearranged after \u223c790,000 yr, which is almost twice the half-life of arabidopsis elements. in contrast, wheat and barley copia elements appear to have a massively longer half-life, beyond our ability to estimate from the available data. these findings suggest that genome size can be explained by the specific rate of dna removal from the genome and the length of active periods of retrotransposon families. \u00a92007 by cold spring harbor laboratory press.",

        "abstracttext": "background: individuals in the same species are assumed to share the same genomic set. however, it is not unusual to find an orthologous gene only in small subset of the species, and recent genomic studies suggest that structural rearrangements are very frequent between genomes in the same species. two recently sequenced rice genomes oryza sativa l. var. nipponbare and o. sativa l. var. 93-11 provide an opportunity to systematically investigate the extent of the gene repertoire polymorphism, even though the genomic data of 93-11 derived from whole-short-gun sequencing is not yet as complete as that of nipponbare. results: we compared gene contents and the genomic locations between two rice genomes. our conservative estimates suggest that at least 10% of the genes in the genomes were either under presence/absence polymorphism (5.2%) or asymmetrically located between genomes (4.7%). the proportion of these \"asymmetric genes\" varied largely among gene groups, in which disease resistance (r) genes and the rlk kinase gene group had 11.6 and 7.8 times higher proportion of asymmetric genes than housekeeping genes (myb and mads). the significant difference in the proportion of asymmetric genes among gene groups suggests that natural selection is responsible for maintaining genomic asymmetry. on the other hand, the nucleotide diversity in 17 r genes under presence/absence polymorphism was generally low (average nucleotide diversity = 0.0051). conclusion: the genomic symmetry was disrupted by 10% of asymmetric genes, which could cause genetic variation through more unequal crossing over, because these genes had no allelic counterparts to pair and then they were free to pair with homologues at non-allelic loci, during meiosis in heterozygotes. it might be a consequence of diversifying selection that increased the structural divergence among genomes, and of purifying selection that decreased nucleotide divergence in each r gene locus. \u00a9 2007 ding et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "with cr-rt-pcr as primary approach we mapped the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 transcript ends of all mitochondrial protein-coding genes in arabidopsis thaliana. almost all transcripts analyzed have single major 3\u2032 termini, while multiple 5\u2032 ends were found for several genes. some of the identified 5\u2032 ends map within promoter motifs suggesting these ends to be derived from transcription initiation while the majority of the 5\u2032 termini seems to be generated post-transcriptionally. assignment of the extremities of 5\u2032 leader rnas revealed clear evidence for an endonucleolytic generation of the major cox1 and atp9 5\u2032 mrna ends. trna-like structures, so-called t-elements, are associated either with 5\u2032 or with 3\u2032 termini of several mrnas. these secondary structures most likely act as cis-signals for endonucleolytic cleavages by rnase z and/or rnase p. since no conserved sequence motif is evident at post-transcriptionally derived ends, we suggest t-elements, stem-loops and probably complex higher order structures as cis-elements for processing. this analysis provides novel insights into 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end formation of mrnas. in addition, the complete transcript map is a substantial and important basis for future studies of gene expression in mitochondria of higher plants. \u00a9 2007 the author(s).",

        "abstracttext": "most plant disease-resistance genes (r-genes) isolated so far encode proteins with a nucleotide binding site (nbs) domain and belong to a superfamily. nbs domains related to r-genes show a highly conserved backbone of an amino acid motif, which makes it possible to isolate resistance gene analogues (rgas) by degenerate primers. degenerate primers based on the conserved motif (p-loop and glpl) of the nbs domain from r-genes were used to isolate rgas from the genomic dna of sweet potato cultivar qingnong no. 2. five distinct clusters of rgas (22 sequences) with the characteristic nbs representing a highly diverse sample were identified in sweet potato genomic dna. sequence identity among the 22 rga nucleotide sequences ranged from 41.2% to 99.4%, while the deduced amino acid sequence identity from the 22 rgas ranged from 20.6% to 100%. the analysis of sweet potato rga sequences suggested mutation as the primary source of diversity. the phylogenetic analyses for rga nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids showed that rgas from sweet potato were classified into two distinct groups-toll and interleukin receptor-1 (tir)-nbs-lrr and non-tir-nbs-lrr. the high degree of similarity between sweet potato rgas and nbs sequences derived from r-genes cloned from tomato, tobacco, flax and potato suggest an ancestral relationship. further studies showed that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution within families was low. these data obtained from sweet potato suggest that the evolution of nbs-encoding sequences in sweet potato occur by the gradual accumulation of mutations leading to purifying selection and slow rates of divergence within distinct r-gene families. \u00a9 indian academy of sciences.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the pentatricopeptide repeat (ppr) is a degenerate 35 amino acid motif that occurs in multiple tandem copies in members of a recently recognized eukaryotic gene family. most analyzed eukaryotic genomes contain only a small number of ppr genes, but in plants the family is greatly expanded. the factors that underlie the expansion of this gene family in plants are not as yet understood. results: we show that the location of ppr genes is highly variable in comparisons between orthologous, closely related, and otherwise co-linear chromosomal regions of the brassica rapa or radish and arabidopsis thaliana. this observation also pertains to paralogous duplicated segments of the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and brassica rapa. in addition, we show that ppr genes that seem closely linearly aligned in these comparisons are not generally found to be closely related to one another at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level. we observe a relatively high level of non-synonomous vs synonomous changes among a group tandemly repeated radish ppr genes, suggesting that these, and possibly other ppr genes, are subject to diversifying selection. we also show that a duplicated region of the arabidopsis genome possesses a relatively high density of ppr genes showing high similarity to restorers of fertility of cytoplasmic male sterile (cms) systems of petunia, radish and rice. the ppr genes in these regions, together with the restorer genes, are more highly similar to one another, in sequence as well as in structure, than to other ppr genes, even within the same sub-family. conclusion: our results suggest are consistent with a model in which at least some ppr genes undergo a \"birth and death\" process that involves transposition to unrelated chromosomal sites. ppr genes hold certain features in common with disease resistance genes (r genes), and their \"nomadic\" character suggests that their evolutionary expansion in plants may have involved novel molecular processes and selective pressures. \u00a9 2007 geddy and brown; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: quantitative phenotypic variation of agronomic characters in crop plants is controlled by environmental and genetic factors (quantitative trait loci = qtl). to understand the molecular basis of such qtl, the identification of the underlying genes is of primary interest and dna sequence analysis of the genomic regions harboring qtl is a prerequisite for that. qtl mapping in potato (solanum tuberosum) has identified a region on chromosome v tagged by dna markers gp21 and gp179, which contains a number of important qtl, among others qtl for resistance to late blight caused by the oomycete phytophthora infestans and to root cyst nematodes. results: to obtain genomic sequence for the targeted region on chromosome v, two local bac (bacterial artificial chromosome) contigs were constructed and sequenced, which corresponded to parts of the homologous chromosomes of the diploid, heterozygous genotype p6/210. two contiguous sequences of 417,445 and 202,781 base pairs were assembled and annotated. gene-by-gene co-linearity was disrupted by non-allelic insertions of retrotransposon elements, stretches of diverged intergenic sequences, differences in gene content and gene order. the latter was caused by inversion of a 70 kbp genomic fragment. these features were also found in comparison to orthologous sequence contigs from three homeologous chromosomes of solanum demissum, a wild tuber bearing species. functional annotation of the sequence identified 48 putative open reading frames (orf) in one contig and 22 in the other, with an average of one orf every 9 kbp. ten orfs were classified as resistance-gene-like, 11 as f-box-containing genes, 13 as transposable elements and three as transcription factors. comparing potato to arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins revealed five micro-syntenic blocks of three to seven orfs with a. thaliana chromosomes 1, 3 and 5. conclusion: comparative sequence analysis revealed highly conserved collinear regions that flank regions showing high variability and tandem duplicated genes. sequence annotation revealed that the majority of the orfs were members of multiple gene families. comparing potato to arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins suggested fragmented structural conservation between these distantly related plant species. \u00a9 2007 ballvora et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the phylogenetic positions of bryophytes and charophytes, together with their genome features, are important for understanding early land plant evolution. here we report the complete nucleotide sequence (105,340 bp) of the circular-mapping mitochondrial dna of the moss physcomitrella patens. available evidence suggests that the multipartite structure of the mitochondrial genome in flowering plants does not occur in physcomitrella. it contains genes for 3 rrnas (rnl, rns, and rrn5), 24 trnas, and 42 conserved mitochondrial proteins (14 ribosomal proteins, 4 ccm proteins, 9 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunits, 5 atpase subunits, 2 succinate dehydrogenase subunits, apocytochrome b, 3 cytochrome oxidase subunits, and 4 other proteins). we estimate that 5 trna genes are missing that might be encoded by the nuclear genome. the overall mitochondrial genome structure is similar in physcomitrella, chara vulgaris, chaetosphaeridium globosum, and marchantia polymorpha, with easily identifiable inversions and translocations. significant synteny with angiosperm and chlorophyte mitochondrial genomes was not detected. phylogenetic analysis of 18 conserved proteins suggests that the moss-liverwort clade is sister to angiosperms, which is consistent with a previous analysis of chloroplast genes but is not consistent with some analyses using mitochondrial sequences. in physcomitrella, 27 introns are present within 16 genes. nine of its intron positions are shared with angiosperms and 4 with marchantia, which in turn shares only one intron position with angiosperms. the phylogenetic analysis as well as the syntenic structure suggest that the mitochondrial genomes of physcomitrella and marchantia retain prototype features among land plant mitochondrial genomes. \u00a9 the author 2006. published by oxford university press on behalf of the society for molecular biology and evolution. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "the high-quality rice genome sequence is serving as a reference for comparative genome analysis in crop plants, especially cereals. however, early comparisons with bread wheat showed complex patterns of conserved synteny (gene content) and colinearity (gene order). here, we show the presence of ancient duplicated segments in the progenitor of wheat, which were first identified in the rice genome. we also show that single-copy (sc) rice genes, those representing unique matches with wheat expressed sequence tag (est) unigene contigs in the whole rice genome, show more than twice the proportion of genes mapping to syntenic wheat chromosome as compared to the multicopy (mc) or duplicated rice genes. while 58.7% of the 1,244 mapped sc rice genes were located in single syntenic wheat chromosome groups, the remaining 41.3% were distributed randomly to the other six non-syntenic wheat groups. this could only be explained by a background dispersal of genes in the genome through transposition or other unknown mechanism. the breakdown of rice-wheat synteny due to such transpositions was much greater near the wheat centromeres. furthermore, the sc rice genes revealed a conserved primordial gene order that gives clues to the origin of rice and wheat chromosomes from a common ancestor through polyploidy, aneuploidy, centromeric fusions, and translocations. apart from the bin-mapped wheat est contigs, we also compared 56,298 predicted rice genes with 39,813 wheat est contigs assembled from 409,765 est sequences and identified 7,241 sc rice gene homologs of wheat. based on the conserved colinearity of 1,063 mapped sc rice genes across the bins of individual wheat chromosomes, we predicted the wheat bin location of 6,178 unmapped sc rice gene homologs and validated the location of 213 of these in the telomeric bins of 21 wheat chromosomes with 35.4% initial success. this opens up the possibility of directed mapping of a large number of conserved sc rice gene homologs in wheat. overall, only 46.4% of these sc genes code for proteins with known functional domains; the remaining 53.6% have unknown function, and hence, represent an important, but yet, under explored category of genes. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2006.",

        "abstracttext": "a multigene family expressed during early floral development was identified on the short arm of wheat chromosome 3d in the region of the ph2 locus, a locus controlling homoeologous chromosome pairing in allohexaploid wheat. physical, genetic and molecular characterisation of the wheat meiosis 1 (wm1) gene family identified seven members that localised within a region of 173-kb. wm1 gene family members were sequenced and they encode mainly type ia plasma membrane-anchored leucine rich repeat-like receptor proteins. in situ expression profiling suggests the gene family is predominantly expressed in floral tissue. in addition to the wm1 gene family, a number of other genes, gene fragments and pseudogenes were identified. it has been predicted that there is approximately one gene every 19-kb and that this region of the wheat genome contains 23 repetitive elements including bare-1 and wis2-1 like sequences. nearly 50% of the repetitive elements identified were similar to known transposons from the cacta superfamily. ty1-copia, ty3-gypsy and athila ltr retroelements were also prevalent within the region. the wm1 gene cluster is present on 3ds and on barley 3hs but missing from the a and b genomes of hexaploid wheat. this suggests either recent generation of the cluster or specific deletion of the cluster during wheat polyploidisation. the evolutionary significance of the cluster, its possible roles in disease response or floral and early meiotic development and its location at or near the ph2 locus are discussed. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2006.",

        "abstracttext": "background: microsatellites are extremely common in plant genomes, and in particular, they are significantly enriched in the 5\u2032 noncoding regions. although some 5\u2032 noncoding microsatellites involved in gene regulation have been described, the general properties of microsatellites as regulatory elements are still unknown. to address the question of microsatellites associated with regulatory elements, we have analyzed the conserved noncoding microsatellite sequences (cnmss) in the 5\u2032 noncoding regions by inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting in the arabidopsis and brassica genomes. results: we ident ified 247 arabidopsis-brassica orthologous and 122 arabidopsis paralogous cnmss, representing 491 ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats, which accounted for 10.6% of these types located in the 500-bp regions upstream of coding sequences in the arabidopsis genome. among these identified cnmss, 18 microsatellites show high conservation in the regulatory regions of both orthologous and paralogous genes, and some of them also appear in the corresponding positions of more distant homologs in arabidopsis, as well as in other plants. a computational scan of cnmss for known cis-regulatory elements showed that light responsive elements were clustered in the region of ct/ga repeats, as well as salicylic acid responsive elements in the (ctt)n/(gaa)n sequences. patterns of gene expression revealed that 70-80% of cnms (ctt)n/(gaa)n associated genes were regulated by salicylic acid, which was consistent with the prediction of regulatory elements in silico. conclusion: our analyses showed that some noncoding microsatell ites were conserved in plants and appeared to be ancient. these cnmss served as regulatory elements involved in light and salicylic acid responses. our findings might have implications in the common features of the over-represented microsatellites for gene regulation in plant-specific pathways. \u00a9 2006 zhang et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: as in other eukaryotes, plant mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades are composed of three classes of hierarchically organized protein kinases, namely mapkkks, mapkks, and mapks. these modules rapidly amplify and transduce extracellular signals into various appropriate intracellular responses. while extensive work has been conducted on the post-translational regulation of specific mapkks and mapks in various plant species, there has been no systematic investigation of the genomic organization and transcriptional regulation of these genes. results: ten putative poplar mapkk genes (ptmkks) and 21 putative poplar mapk genes (ptmpks) have been identified and located within the poplar (populus trichocarpa) genome. analysis of exonintron junctions and of intron phase inside the predicted coding region of each candidate gene has revealed high levels of conservation within and between phylogenetic groups. expression profiles of all members of these two gene families were also analyzed in 17 different poplar organs, using gene-specific primers directed at the 3\u2032-untranslated region of each candidate gene and real-time quantitative pcr. most ptmkks and ptmpks were differentially expressed across this developmental series. conclusion: this analysis provides a complete survey of mapkk and mapk gene expression profiles in poplar, a large woody perennial plant, and thus complements the extensive expression profiling data available for the herbaceous annual arabidopsis thaliana. the poplar genome is marked by extensive segmental and chromosomal duplications, and within both kinase families, some recently duplicated paralogous gene pairs often display markedly different patterns of expression, consistent with the rapid evolution of specialized protein functions in this highly adaptive species. \u00a9 2006 nicole et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: large scale gene analysis of most organisms is hampered by incomplete genomic sequences. in many organisms, such as soybean, the best source of sequence information is the existence of expressed sequence tag (est) libraries. soybean has a large (1115 mbp) genome that has yet to be fully sequenced. however it does have the 6th largest est collection comprised of ests from a variety of soybean genotypes. many est libraries were constructed from rna extracted from various genetic backgrounds, thus gene identification from these sources is complicated by the existence of both gene and allele sequence differences. we used the est miner suite of programs to identify potential soybean gene transcripts from a single genetic background allowing us to observe functional classifications between gene families as well as structural differences between genes and gene paralogs within families. the identification of potential gene sequences (phaps) from soybean allows us to begin to get a picture of the genomic history of the organism as well as begin to observe the evolutionary fates of gene copies in this highly duplicated genome. results: we identified approximately 45,000 potential gene sequences (phaps) from est sequences of williams/williams82, an inbred genotype of soybean (glycine max l. merr.) using a redundancy criterion to identify reproducible sequence differences between related genes within gene families. analysis of these sequences revealed single base substitutions and single base indels are the most frequently observed form of sequence variation between genes within families in the dataset. genomic sequencing of selected loci indicate that intron-like intervening sequences are numerous and are approximately 220 bp in length. functional annotation of gene sequences indicate functional classifications are not randomly distributed among gene families containing few or many genes. conclusion: the predominance of single nucleotide insertion/deletions and substitution events between genes within families (individual genes and gene paralogs) is consistent with a model of gene amplification followed by single base random mutational events expected under the classical model of duplicated gene evolution. molecular functions of small and large gene families appear to be non-randomly distributed possibly indicating a difference in retention of duplicates or local expansion. \u00a9 2006 nelson and shoemaker; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "a key question in biology is how differences in gene function or regulation produce new morphologies during evolution. here we investigate the genetic basis for differences in leaf form between two closely related plant species, arabidopsis thaliana and cardamine hirsuta. we report that in c. hirsuta, class i knotted1-like homeobox (knox) proteins are required in the leaf to delay cellular differentiation and produce a dissected leaf form, in contrast to a. thaliana, in which knox exclusion from leaves results in a simple leaf form. these differences in knox expression arise through changes in the activity of upstream gene regulatory sequences. the function of asymmetric leaves1/roughsheath2/phantastica (arp) proteins to repress knox expression is conserved between the two species, but in c. hirsuta the arp-knox regulatory module controls new developmental processes in the leaf. thus, evolutionary tinkering with knox regulation, constrained by arp function, may have produced diverse leaf forms by modulating growth and differentiation patterns in developing leaf primordia. \u00a9 2006 nature publishing group.",

        "abstracttext": "background: pairing of homologous chromosomes at meiosis is an important requirement for recombination and balanced chromosome segregation among the products of meiotic division. recombination is initiated by double strand breaks (dsbs) made by spol 1 followed by interaction of dsb sites with a homologous chromosome. this interaction requires the strand exchange proteins rad51 and dmc1 that bind to single stranded regions created by resection of ends at the site of dsbs and promote interactions with uncut dna on the homologous partner. recombination is also considered to be dependent on factors that stabilize interactions between homologous chromosomes. in budding yeast hop2 and mnd1 act as a complex to promote homologous pairing and recombination in conjunction with rad51 and dmc1. results: we have analyzed the function of the arabidopsis orthologue of the budding yeast. mnd1 gene (atmnd1). loss of atmnd1 did not affect normal vegetative development but caused fragmentation and missegregation of chromosomes in male and female meiosis, formation of inviable gametes, and sterility. analysis of the atmnd1 atspol 1-1 double mutant indicated that chromosome fragmentation in atmnd1 was suppressed by loss of atspol 1-1. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis showed that homologous pairing failed to occur and homologues remained apart throughout meiosis. atmnd1 showed strong expression in meiocytes as revealed by rna in situs. conclusion: we conclude that atmnd1 is required for homologous pairing and is likely to play a role in the repair of dna double strand breaks during meiosis in arabidopsis, thus showing conservation of function with that of mnd1 during meiosis in yeast. \u00a9 2006 panoli et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the genome of plants, like that of other eukaryotes, is organized into chromatin, a compact structure that reduces the accessibility of dna to machineries such as transcription, replication, and dna recombination and repair. plant genes, which contain the characteristic atpase/helicase motifs of the chromatin remodeling swi2/snf2 family of proteins, have been thoroughly studied, but their role in homologous recombination or dna repair has received limited attention. we have searched for homologs of the yeast rad54 gene, whose role in recombination and repair and in chromatin remodeling is well established. forty arabidopsis swi2/snf2 genes were identified and the function of a selected group of 14 was analyzed. mutant analysis and/or rnai-mediated silencing showed that 11 of the 14 genes tested played a role in response to dna damage. two of the 14 genes were involved in homologous recombination between inverted repeats. the putative ortholog of rad54 and close homologs of ercc6/rad26 were involved in dna damage response, suggesting functional conservation across kingdoms. in addition, genes known for their role in development, such as pickle/gymnos and pie1, or in silencing, such as ddm1, turned out to also be involved in dna damage response. a comparison of ddm1 and met1 mutants suggests that dna damage response is affected essentially by chromatin structure and that cytosine methylation is less critical. these results emphasize the broad involvement of the swi2/snf2 family, and thus of chromatin remodeling, in genome maintenance and the link between epigenetic and genetic processes. copyright \u00a9 2006 by the genetics society of america.",

        "abstracttext": "background: the maize indeterminate1 gene, id 1, is a key regulator of the transition to flowering and the founding member of a transcription factor gene family that encodes a protein with a distinct arrangement of zinc finger motifs. the zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make up the signature id domain (idd), which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes. the presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that id 1 binds to dna suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation. results: comparison of idd genes identified in arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all idd genes discovered in maize est and genomic databases, suggest that id 1 is a unique member of this gene family. high levels of sequence similarity amongst all idd genes from maize, rice and arabidopsis suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. several unique features of id 1 suggest that it is a divergent member of the maize idd family. although no clear id 1 ortholog was identified in the arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond the id domain were isolated from rice and sorghum. phylogenetic comparisons show that these putative orthologs, along with maize id 1, form a group separate from other idd genes. in contrast to id 1 mrna, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize idd genes showed a broad range of expression in various tissues. further, western analysis with an antibody that cross-reacts with id 1 protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three proteins are detected in immature leaves only. conclusion: comparative genomic analysis shows that the idd zinc finger family is highly conserved among both monocots and dicots. the leaf-specific id 1 expression pattern distinguishes it from other maize idd genes examined. a similar leaf-specific localization pattern was observed for the putative id 1 protein orthologs from rice and sorghum. these similarities between id 1 and closely related genes in other grasses point to possible similarities in function. \u00a9 2006 colansanti et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "background: due to the lack of availability of large genomic sequences for peach or other prunus species, the degree of synteny conservation between the prunus species and arabidopsis has not been systematically assessed. using the recently available peach est sequences that are anchored to prunus genetic maps and to peach physical map, we analyzed the extent of conserved synteny between the prunus and the arabidopsis genomes. the reconstructed pseudo-ancestral arabidopsis genome, existed prior to the proposed recent polyploidy event, was also utilized in our analysis to further elucidate the evolutionary relationship. results: we analyzed the synteny conservation between the prunus and the arabidopsis genomes by comparing 475 peach ests that are anchored to prunus genetic maps and their arabidopsis homologs detected by sequence similarity. microsyntenic regions were detected between all five arabidopsis chromosomes and seven of the eight linkage groups of the prunus reference map. an additional 1097 peach ests that are anchored to 431 bac contigs of the peach physical map and their arabidopsis homologs were also analyzed. microsyntenic regions were detected in 77 bac contigs. the syntenic regions from both data sets were short and contained only a couple of conserved gene pairs. the synteny between peach and arabidopsis was fragmentary; all the prunus linkage groups containing syntenic regions matched to more than two different arabidopsis chromosomes, and most bac contigs with multiple conserved syntenic regions corresponded to multiple arabidopsis chromosomes. using the same peach est datasets, and their arabidopsis homologs, we also detected conserved syntenic regions in the pseudo-ancestral arabidopsis genome. in many cases, the gene order and content of peach regions was more conserved in the ancestral genome than in the present arabidopsis region. statistical significance of each syntenic group was calculated using simulated arabidopsis genome. conclusion: we report here the result of the first extensive analysis of the conserved microsynteny using dna sequences across the prunus genome and their arabidopsis homologs. our study also illustrates that both the ancestral and present arabidopsis genomes can provide a useful resource for marker saturation and candidate gene search, as well as elucidating evolutionary relationships between species. \u00a9 2006 jung et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "transposable elements (tes) can be viewed as genetic parasites that persist in populations due to their capacity for increase in copy number and the inefficacy of selection against them. a corollary of this hypothesis is that tes are more likely to spread within sexual populations and be eliminated or inactivated within asexual populations. while previous work with animals has shown that asexual taxa may contain less te diversity than sexual taxa, comparable work with plants has been lacking. here we report the results of a study of ty1/copia, ty3/ gypsy, and line-like retroelement diversity in four asexual plant species. retroelement-like sequences, with a high degree of conservation both within and between species, were isolated from all four species. the sequences correspond to several previously annotated retroelement subfamilies. they also exhibit a pattern of nucleotide substitution characterized by an excess of synonymous substitutions, suggestive of a history of purifying selection. these findings were compared with retroelement sequence evolution in sexual plant taxa. one likely explanation for the discovery of conserved te sequences in the genomes of these asexual taxa is simply that asexuality within these taxa evolved relatively recently, such that the loss and breakdown of tes is not yet detectable through analysis of sequence diversity. this explanation is examined by conducting stochastic simulation of te evolution and by using published information to infer rough estimates of the ages of asexual taxa. \u00a9 springer science+business media, inc. 2006.",

        "abstracttext": "background: there are thousands of maize lines with distinctive normal as well as mutant phenotypes. to determine the validity of comparisons among mutants in different lines, we first address the question of how similar the transcriptomes are in three standard lines at four developmental stages. results: four tissues (leaves, 1 mm anthers, 1.5 mm anthers, pollen) from one hybrid and one inbred maize line were hybridized with the w23 inbred on agilent oligonucleotide microarrays with 21,000 elements. tissue-specific gene expression patterns were documented, with leaves having the most tissue-specific transcripts. haploid pollen expresses about half as many genes as the other samples. high overlap of gene expression was found between leaves and anthers. anther and pollen transcript expression showed high conservation among the three lines while leaves had more divergence. antisense transcripts represented about 6 to 14 percent of total transcriptome by tissue type but were similar across lines. gene ontology (go) annotations were assigned and tabulated. enrichment in go terms related to cell-cycle functions was found for the identified antisense transcripts. microarray results were validated via quantitative real-time pcr and by hybridization to a second oligonucleotide microarray platform. conclusion: despite high polymorphisms and structural differences among maize inbred lines, the transcriptomes of the three lines displayed remarkable similarities, especially in both reproductive samples (anther and pollen). we also identified potential stage markers for maize anther development. a large number of antisense transcripts were detected and implicated in important biological functions given the enrichment of particular go classes. \u00a9 2006 ma et al.; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "we evaluated the genetic consequences and efficiency of conservation practices in oryza rufipogon using microsatellite dna markers. spatial autocorrelation analysis from 12 microsatellite loci revealed that microsatellite alleles were exclusively distributed in patches within the population, indicating that large populations were unlikely to be homogeneous. an in situ conserved stand of o. rufipogon, which has been protected by a concrete wall from a large population, captured only 67.9% of the total genetic variation of the previous large population. the concrete wall was built to protect the wild rice, but it acted more as a physical barrier to gene exchanges between the two sides. an assignment test revealed only 11.1% putative seed exchanges across the wall. a reintroduced population was found to be genetically very diverse. about 76.3% of the total genetic variation detected in other populations was captured in this reintroduced population, and 24.8% of the total genetic variation in this population was not found in other populations. these results display two important findings for conservation of o. rufipogon. first, conserving one part of a large population of o. rufipogon will not preserve an adequate sample of the genetic variability, since populations are not homogeneous, and genotype distribution varies among localities. second, a reintroduced population is not genetically depauperate, but it is too early to assess its long-term survival. \u00a9 2005 springer science+business media, inc.",

        "abstracttext": "background: ginkgo biloba l. is the only surviving member of one of the oldest living seed plant groups with medicinal, spiritual and horticultural importance worldwide. as an evolutionary relic, it displays many characters found in the early, extinct seed plants and extant cycads. to establish a molecular base to understand the evolution of seeds and pollen, we created a cdna library and est dataset from the reproductive structures of male (microsporangiate), female (megasporangiate), and vegetative organs (leaves) of ginkgo biloba. results: rna from newly emerged male and female reproductive organs and immature leaves was used to create three distinct cdna libraries from which 6,434 ests were generated. these 6,434 ests from ginkgo biloba were clustered into 3,830 unigenes. a comparison of our ginkgo unigene set against the fully annotated genomes of rice and arabidopsis, and all available ests in genbank revealed that 256 ginkgo unigenes match only genes among the gymnosperms and non-seed plants - many with multiple matches to genes in non-angiosperm plants. conversely, another group of unigenes in gingko had highly significant homology to transcription factors in angiosperms involved in development, including mads box genes as well as post-transcriptional regulators. several of the conserved developmental genes found in ginkgo had top blast homology to cycad genes. we also note here the presence of ests in g. biloba similar to genes that to date have only been found in gymnosperms and an additional 22 ginkgo genes common only to genes from cycads. conclusion: our analysis of an est dataset from g. biloba revealed genes potentially unique to gymnosperms. many of these genes showed homology to fully sequenced clones from our cycad est dataset found in common only with gymnosperms. other ginkgo ests are similar to developmental regulators in higher plants. this work sets the stage for future studies on ginkgo to better understand seed and pollen evolution, and to resolve the ambiguous phylogenetic relationship of g. biloba among the gymnosperms. \u00a9 2005 brenner et al., licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the classic abc model explains the activities of each class of floral homeotic genes in specifying the identity of floral organs. thus, changes in these genes may underlay the origin of floral diversity during evolution. in this study, three mads-box genes were isolated from the perianthless basal angiosperm chloranthus spicatus. sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that they are ap1-like, ap3-like and sep3-like genes, and hence these genes were termed csap1, csap3 and cssep3, respectively. due to these assignments, they represent candidate class a, class b and class e genes, respectively. expression patterns suggest that the csap1, csap3 and cssep3 genes function during flower development of c. spicatus. csap1 is expressed broadly in the flower, which may reflect the ancestral function of squa-like genes in the specification of inflorescence and floral meristems rather than in patterning of the flower. csap3 is exclusively expressed in male floral organs, providing the evidence that ap3-like genes have ancestral function in differentiation between male and female reproductive organs. cssep3 expression is not detectable in spike meristems, but its mrna accumulates throughout the flower, supporting the view that sep-like genes have conserved expression pattern and function throughout angiosperm. studies of synonymous vs nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions indicate that these genes have not evolved under changes in evolutionary forces. all the data above suggest that the genes may have maintained at least some ancestral functions despite the lack of perianth in the flowers of c. spicatus. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2005.",

        "abstracttext": "motivation: a fundamental problem of computational genomics is identifying the genes that respond to certain endogenous cues and environmental stimuli. this problem can be referred to as targeted gene finding. since gene regulation is mainly determined by the binding of transcription factors and cis-regulatory dna sequences, most existing gene annotation methods, which exploit the conservation of open reading frames, are not effective in finding target genes. results: a viable approach to targeted gene finding is to exploit the cis-regulatory elements that are known to be responsible for the transcription of target genes. given such cis-elements, putative target genes whose promoters contain the elements can be identified. as a case study, we apply the above approach to predict the genes in model plant arabidopsis thaliana which are inducible by a phytohormone, abscisic acid (aba), and abiotic stress, such as drought, cold and salinity. we first construct and analyze two aba specific cis-elements, aba-responsive element (abre) and its coupling element (ce), in a.thaliana, based on their conservation in rice and other cereal plants. we then use the abre-ce module to identify putative aba-responsive genes in a.thaliana. based on rt-pcr verification and the results from literature, this method has an accuracy rate of 67.5% for the top 40 predictions. the cis-element based targeted gene finding approach is expected to be widely applicable since a large number of cis-elements in many species are available. \u00a9 the author 2005. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "the technique of chromosomal orientation and direction fluorescence in situ hybridization (cod-fish) was adapted for plant chromosomes in order to study long-range organization of two families of satellite repeats, victr-b of vicia sativa and pistr-b of pisum sativum. the technique allowed fish to be performed on mitotic chromosomes in a strand-specific manner, resulting in visualization of the repeat orientation along the chromosomes and with respect to the direction of telomeric repeats. the victr-b probe applied to v. sativa chromosomes produced signals on a single chromatid at most regions containing corresponding sequences, thus confirming a presence of long arrays of head-to-tail arranged repeat monomers which is typical for satellite dna. however, hybridization signals of different or equal intensities on both chromatids were also detected at some loci, suggesting a more complex arrangement of the repeats. similar observations were made for pistr-b repeats on p. sativum chromosomes, although the proportion of loci displaying signals on both chromatids was lower. in contrast to victr-b, orientation of the pistr-b clusters with respect to telomeric sequences appeared to be conserved among subtelomeric regions of metacentric chromosomes and of the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. copyright \u00a9 2005 s. karger ag, basel.",

        "abstracttext": "background: in plants, rna editing is a process that converts specific cytidines to uridines and uridines to cytidines in transcripts from virtually all mitochondrial protein-coding genes. there are thousands of plant mitochondrial genes in the sequence databases, but sites of rna editing have not been determined for most. accurate methods of rna editing site prediction will be important in filling in this information gap and could reduce or even eliminate the need for experimental determination of editing sites for many sequences. because rna editing tends to increase protein conservation across species by \"correcting\" codons that specify unconserved amino acids, this principle can be used to predict editing sites by identifying positions where an rna editing event would increase the conservation of a protein to homologues from other plants. prep-mt takes this approach to predict editing sites for any protein-coding gene in plant mitochondria. results: to test the general applicability of the prep-mt methodology, rna editing sites were predicted for 370 full-length or nearly full-length dna sequences and then compared to the known sites of rna editing for these sequences. of 60,263 cytidines in this test set, prep-mt correctly classified 58,994 as either an edited or unedited site (accuracy = 97.9%). prep-mt properly identified 3,038 of the 3,698 known sites of rna editing (sensitivity = 82.2%) and 55,956 of the 56,565 known unedited sites (specificity = 98.9%). accuracy and sensitivity increased to 98.7% and 94.7%, respectively, after excluding the 489 silent editing sites (which have no effect on protein sequence or function) from the test set. conclusion: these results indicate that prep-mt is effective at identifying c to u rna editing sites in plant mitochondrial protein-coding genes. thus, prep-mt should be useful in predicting protein sequences for use in molecular, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses. in addition, prep-mt could be used to determine functionality of a mitochondrial gene or to identify particular sequences with unusual editing properties. the prep-mt methodology should be applicable to any system where rna editing increases protein conservation across species. \u00a9 2005 mower; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "plant genomes, in particular grass genomes, evolve very rapidly. the closely related a genomes of diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat are derived from a common ancestor that lived <3 million years ago and represent a good model to study molecular mechanisms involved in such rapid evolution. we have sequenced and compared physical contigs at the lr10 locus on chromosome 1as from diploid (211 kb), tetraploid (187 kb), and hexaploid wheat (154 kb). a maximum of 33% of the sequences were conserved between two species. the sequences from diploid and tetraploid wheat shared all of the genes, including lr10 and rga2 and define a first haplotype (h1). the 130-kb intergenic region between lr10 and rga2 was conserved in size despite its activity as a hot spot for transposon insertion, which resulted in >70% of sequence divergence. the hexaploid wheat sequence lacks both lr10 and rga2 genes and defines a second haplotype, h2, which originated from ancient and extensive rearrangements. these rearrangements included insertions of retroelements and transposons deletions, as well as unequal recombination within elements. gene disruption in haplotype h2 was caused by a deletion and subsequent large inversion. gene conservation between h1 haplotypes, as well as conservation of rearrangements at the origin of the h2 haplotype at three different ploidy levels indicate that the two haplotypes are ancient and had a stable gene content during evolution, whereas the intergenic regions evolved rapidly. polyploidization during wheat evolution had no detectable consequences on the structure and evolution of the two haplotypes. \u00a92005 by cold spring harbor laboratory press.",

        "abstracttext": "floral organ identity b class genes are generally recognized as being required for development of petals and stamens in angiosperm flowers. spinach flowers are distinguished in their complete absence of petals in both sexes, and the absence of a developed stamen whorl in female flowers. as such, we hypothesized that differential expression of b class floral identity genes is integral to the sexual dimorphism in spinach flowers. we isolated two spinach orthologs of arabidopsis b class genes by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 race. homology assignments were tested by comparisons of percent amino acid identities, searches for diagnostic consensus amino acid residues, conserved motifs, and phylogenetic groupings. in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that both spinach b class genes are expressed throughout the male floral meristem in early stages, and continue to be expressed in sepal primordia in reduced amounts at later stages of development. they are also highly expressed in the third whorl primordia when they arise and continue to be expressed in these tissues through the development of mature anthers. in contrast, neither gene can be detected in any stage in female flowers by in situ analyses, although northern blot experiments indicate low levels of spap3 within the inflorescence. the early, strong expressions of both b class floral identity genes in male floral primordia and their absence in female flowers demonstrate that b class gene expression precedes the origination of third whorl primordia (stamen) in males and is associated with the establishment of sexual floral dimorphism as it initiates in the first (sepal) whorl. these observations suggest that regulation of b class floral identity genes has a role in the development of sexual dimorphism and dioecy in spinach rather than being a secondary result of organ abortion. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2005.",

        "abstracttext": "background: a gc-compositional strand bias or gc-skew (=(c-g)/(c+g)), where c and g denote the numbers of cytosine and guanine residues, was recently reported near the transcription start sites (tss) of arabidopsis genes. however, it is unclear whether other eukaryotic species have equally prominent gc-skews, and the biological meaning of this trait remains unknown. results: our study confirmed a significant gc-skew (c > g) in the tss of oryza sativa (rice) genes. the full-length cdnas and genomic sequences from arabidopsis and rice were compared using statistical analyses. despite marked differences in the g+c content around the tss in the two plants, the degrees of bias were almost identical. although slight gc-skew peaks, including opposite skews (c < g), were detected around the tss of genes in human and drosophila, they were qualitatively and quantitatively different from those identified in plants. however, plant-like gc-skew in regions upstream of the translation initiation sites (tis) in some fungi was identified following analyses of the expressed sequence tags and/or genomic sequences from other species. on the basis of our dataset, we estimated that >70 and 68% of arabidopsis and rice genes, respectively, had a strong gc-skew (>0.33) in a 100-bp window (that is, the number of c residues was more than double the number of g residues in a +/-100-bp window around the tss). the mean gc-skew value in the tss of highly-expressed genes in arabidopsis was significantly greater than that of genes with low expression levels. many of the gc-skew peaks were preferentially located near the tss, so we examined the potential value of gc-skew as an index for tss identification. our results confirm that the gc-skew can be used to assist the tss prediction in plant genomes. conclusion: the gc-skew (c > g) around the tss is strictly conserved between monocot and eudicot plants (ie. angiosperms in general), and a similar skew has been observed in some fungi. highly-expressed arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked gc-skew in the tss compared to genes with low expression levels. we therefore propose that the gc-skew around the tss in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. it might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. in addition, gc-skew is a good candidate index for tss prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among cpg islands and genes. \u00a9 2005 fujimori et al; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "this study demonstrates that sequences homologous to those of the non-retro rna virus (potato virus y; pvy) are integrated into the genome of several grapevine varieties. the integrated pvy-coat-protein-like cistron is expressed in the grapevine as indicated by southern and western blot analyses as well as by rnase protection assay. in addition, genome-walking studies showed that one pvy-like sequence is flanked by 41-bp direct repeats and is embedded in authentic grapevine sequences, flanked by inverted repeats. rearranged pvy-like sequences were also found in tobacco. it is suggested that nonhomologous recombination of a potyviral rna with rna of a retrotransposable element took place at some point in evolution. the initial integration locus was probably within a grapevine gene homologous to a pentatricopeptide repeat-carrying protein, and was later transposed to other locations. the current location is reminiscent of a mite-type retroelement, indicating transposition history. because grapevine cultivars are propagated asexually, without going through a meiotic phase, the chance for dna recombination is minimal and the foreign integrated sequence may be better conserved, enabling it to be expressed correctly in the recipient genome. \u00a9 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "background: earlier comparative maps between the genomes of rice (oryza sativa l.), barley (hordeum vulgare l.) and wheat (triticum aestivum l.) were linkage maps based on cdna-rflp markers. the low number of polymorphic rflp markers has limited the development of dense genetic maps in wheat and the number of available anchor points in comparative maps. higher density comparative maps using pcr-based anchor markers are necessary to better estimate the conservation of colinearity among cereal genomes. the purposes of this study were to characterize the proportion of transcribed dna sequences containing simple sequence repeats (ssr or microsatellites) by length and motif for wheat, barley and rice and to determine in-silico rice genome locations for primer sets developed for wheat and barley expressed sequence tags. results: the proportions of ssr types (di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide repeats) and motifs varied with the length of the ssrs within and among the three species, with trinucleotide ssrs being the most frequent. distributions of genomic microsatellites (gssrs), est-derived microsatellites (est-ssrs), and transcribed regions in the contiguous sequence of rice chromosome 1 were highly correlated. more than 13,000 primer pairs were developed for use by the cereal research community as potential markers in wheat, barley and rice. conclusion: trinucleotide ssrs were the most common type in each of the species; however, the relative proportions of ssr types and motifs differed among rice, wheat, and barley. genomic microsatellites were found to be primarily located in gene-rich regions of the rice genome. microsatellite markers derived from the use of non-redundant est-ssrs are an economic and efficient alternative to rflp for comparative mapping in cereals. \u00a9 2005 la rota et al; licencee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the most abundant organic compound produced by plants is cellulose; however, it has long been accepted that most animals do not produce endogenous enzymes required for its degradation, but rely instead on symbiotic relationships with microbes that produce the necessary enzymes. here, we present the genomic organisation of an endogenous glycosyl hydrolase family (ghf) 9 gene in redclaw crayfish (cherax quadricarinatus), consolidated from a cdna sequence determined by byrne et al. [gene 239 (1999) 317-324.]. comparison with several other invertebrate ghf9 genes reveals the conservation of both intron position/phase and splice sequence, which adds support to an argument for an ancestral animal cellulase gene. furthermore, two introns in plant ghf9 genes are also identical in position, implying a more ancient origin for this class of animal cellulase. protein purification from redclaw gastric fluid via fast performance liquid chromatography (fplc) indicated the presence of two endoglucanase enzymes. the molecular weights of these components were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation - time-of-flight (maldi-tof) to be 47,887 da (cel1) and 50,295 da (cel2). cel1 is possibly the functional product of the described cellulase gene, with n-terminal amino acid residues identical to the translated amino acid sequence from the corresponding gene region. cel2 was identical to cel1 for 7 of 11 n-terminal residues and likely to be the product of a paralogous endoglucanase gene. these results suggest that redclaw crayfish possess at least one and possibly two functional, endoglucanase enzymes, although further work is required to confirm their origin and attributes. \u00a9 2004 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",

        "abstracttext": "background: synaptotagmins exist as a large gene family in mammals. there is much interest in the function of certain family members which act crucially in the regulated synaptic vesicle exocytosis required for efficient neurotransmission. knowledge of the functions of other family members is relatively poor and the presence of synaptotagmin genes in plants indicates a role for the family as a whole which is wider than neurotransmission. identification of the synaptotagmin genes within completely sequenced genomes can provide the entire synaptotagmin gene complement of each sequenced organism. defining the detailed structures of all the synaptotagmin genes and their encoded products can provide a useful resource for functional studies and a deeper understanding of the evolution of the gene family. the current rapid increase in the number of sequenced genomes from different branches of the tree of life, together with the public deposition of evolutionarily diverse transcript sequences make such studies worthwhile. results: i have compiled a detailed list of the synaptotagmin genes of caenorhabditis, anopheles, drosophila, ciona, danio, fugu, mus, homo, arabidopsis and oryza by examining genomic and transcript sequences from public sequence databases together with some transcript sequences obtained by cdna library screening and rt-pcr. i have compared all of the genes and investigated the relationship between plant synaptotagmins and their non-synaptotagmin counterparts. conclusions: i have identified and compared 98 synaptotagmin genes from 10 sequenced genomes. detailed comparison of transcript sequences reveals abundant and complex variation in synaptotagmin gene expression and indicates the presence of synaptotagmin genes in all animals and land plants. amino acid sequence comparisons indicate patterns of conservation and diversity in function. phylogenetic analysis shows the origin of synaptotagmins in multicellular eukaryotes and their great diversification in animals. synaptotagmins occur in land plants and animals in combinations of 4-16 in different species. the detailed delineation of the synaptotagmin genes presented here, will allow easier identification of synaptotagmins in future. since the functional roles of many of these genes are unknown, this gene collection provides a useful resource for future studies. \u00a9 2004 craxton; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "the dna sequence of 106 bac/pac clones in the minimum tiling path (mtp) of the long arm of rice chromosome 11, between map positions 57.3 and 116.2\u00d7 cm, has been assembled to phase 2 or pln level. this region has been sequenced to 10\u00d7 redundancy by the indian initiative for rice genome sequencing (iirgs) and is now publicly available in genbank. the region, excluding overlaps, has been predicted to contain 2,932 genes using different software. a gene-by-gene blastn search of the ncbi wheat est database of over 420,000 cdna sequences revealed that 1,143 of the predicted rice genes (38.9%) have significant homology to wheat ests (bit score \u2265 100). further blastn search of these 1,143 rice genes with the graingenes database of sequence contigs containing bin-mapped wheat ests allowed 113 of the genes to be placed in bins located on wheat chromosomes of different homoeologous groups. the largest number of genes, about one-third, mapped to the homoeologous group 4 chromosomes of wheat, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. the remaining genes were located on wheat chromosomes of different groups with significantly higher numbers for groups 3 and 5. location of bin-mapped wheat contigs to chromosomes of all the seven homoeologous groups can be ascribed to movement of genes (transpositions) or chromosome segments (translocations) within rice or the hexaploid wheat genomes. alternatively, it could be due to ancient duplications in the common ancestral genome of wheat and rice followed by selective elimination of genes in the wheat and rice genomes. while there exists definite conservation of gene sequences and the ancestral chromosomal identity between rice and wheat, there is no obvious conservation of the gene order at this level of resolution. lack of extensive colinearity between rice and wheat genomes suggests that there have been many insertions, deletions, duplications and translocations that make the synteny comparisons much more complicated than earlier thought. however, enhanced resolution of comparative sequence analysis may reveal smaller conserved regions of colinearity, which will facilitate selection of markers for saturation mapping and sequencing of the gene-rich regions of the wheat genome. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2004.",

        "abstracttext": "the conservation of the linear order (colinearity) of genetic markers along large chromosome segments in wheat and rice is well established, but less is known about the microcolinearity between both genomes at subcentimorgan distances. in this study we focused on the microcolinearity between a 2.6-cm interval flanked by markers xcdo365 and xucw65 on wheat chromosome 6b and rice chromosome 2. a previous study has shown that this wheat segment includes the gpc-6b1 locus, which is responsible for large differences in grain protein content (gpc) and is the target of a positional cloning effort in our laboratories. twenty-one recombination events between xcdo365 and xucw65 were found in a large segregating population (935 gametes) and used to map 17 genes selected from rice chromosome 2 in the wheat genetic map. we found a high level of colinearity between a 2.1-cm region flanked by loci xucw75 and xucw67 on wheat chromosome 6b and a 350-kb uninterrupted sequenced region in rice chromosome arm 2s. colinearity between these two genomes was extended to the region proximal to xucw67 (eight colinear rflp markers), but was interrupted distal to xucw75 (six non-colinear rflp markers). analysis of different comparative studies between rice and wheat suggests that microcolinearity is more frequently disrupted in the distal region of the wheat chromosomes. fortunately, the region encompassing the gpc-6b1 locus showed an excellent conservation between the two genomes, facilitating the saturation of the target region of the wheat genetic map with molecular markers. these markers were used to map the gpc-6b1 locus into a 0.3-cm interval flanked by pcr markers xucw79 and xucw71, and to identify five candidate genes within the colinear 64-kb region in rice. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2004.",

        "abstracttext": "the use of dna sequence-based comparative genomics for evolutionary studies and for transferring information from model species to related large-genome species has revolutionized molecular genetics and breeding strategies for improving those crops. comparative sequence analysis methods can be used to cross-reference genes between species maps, enhance the resolution of comparative maps, study patterns of gene evolution, identify conserved regions of the genomes, and facilitate interspecies gene cloning. in this study, 5,780 triticeae ests that have been physically mapped using wheat (triticum aestivum l.) deletion lines and segregating populations were compared using ncbi blastn to the first draft of the public rice (oryza sativa l.) genome sequence data from 3,280 ordered bac/pac clones. a rice genome view of the homoeologous wheat genome locations based on sequence analysis shows general similarity to the previously published comparative maps based on southern analysis of rflp. for most rice chromosomes there is a preponderance of wheat genes from one or two wheat chromosomes. the physical locations of non-conserved regions were not consistent across rice chromosomes. some wheat ests with multiple wheat genome locations are associated with the non-conserved regions of similarity between rice and wheat. the inverse view, showing the relationship between the wheat deletion map and rice genomic sequence, revealed the breakdown of gene content and order at the resolution conferred by the physical chromosome deletions in the wheat genome. an average of 35% of the putative single copy genes that were mapped to the most conserved bins matched rice chromosomes other than the one that was most similar. this suggests that there has been an abundance of rearrangements, insertions, deletions, and duplications eroding the wheat-rice genome relationship that may complicate the use of rice as a model for cross-species transfer of information in non-conserved regions. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2004.",

        "abstracttext": "apyrases have been suggested to play important roles in plant nutrition, photomorphogenesis, and nodulation. to help trace the evolution of these genes in the legumes - and possibly, the acquisition of new functions for nodulation - apyrase-containing bacs were sequenced from three legume genomes. genomic sequences from medicago truncatula, glycine max and lotus japonicus were compared to one another and to corresponding regions in arabidopsis thaliana. a phylogenetic analysis of apyrase homologs from these regions and sequences from other legume species, as well as other plant families, identified a potentially legume-specific clade that contains a well-characterized soybean (g. soja) apyrase, gs52, as well as homologs from dolichos, lotus , medicago and pisum. sister clades contain homologs from members of brassicaceae, solanaceae, poaceae and fabaceae. comparisons of rates of change at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the gs52 and sister clades show rapid evolution in the potentially legume-specific gs52 clade. the genomic organization of the apyrase-containing bacs shows evidence of gene duplication, genomic rearrangement, and gene conversion among gs52 homologs. taken together, these results suggest a scenario of local apyrase gene duplication in an ancestor of the legumes, followed by functional diversification and increased rates of change in the new genes, and further duplications in the galegae (which include the genera medicago and pisum). the study also provides a detailed comparison of genomic regions between two model genomes which are now being sequenced (m. truncatula and l. japonicus), and a genome from an economically important legume species (g. max).",

        "abstracttext": "background: the kelch motif is an ancient and evolutionarily-widespread sequence motif of 44-56 amino acids in length. it occurs as five to seven repeats that form a \u03b2-propeller tertiary structure. over 28 kelch-repeat proteins have been sequenced and functionally characterised from diverse organisms spanning from viruses, plants and fungi to mammals and it is evident from expressed sequence tag, domain and genome databases that many additional hypothetical proteins contain kelch-repeats. in general, kelch-repeat \u03b2 -propellers are involved in protein-protein interactions, however the modest sequence identity between kelch motifs, the diversity of domain architectures, and the partial information on this protein family in any single species, all present difficulties to developing a coherent view of the kelch-repeat domain and the kelch-repeat protein superfamily. to understand the complexity of this superfamily of proteins, we have analysed by bioinformatics the complement of kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome and have made comparisons to the kelch-repeat proteins encoded in other sequenced genomes. results: we identified 71 kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome, whereas 5 or 8 members were identified in yeasts and around 18 in c. elegans, d. melanogaster and a. gambiae. multiple domain architectures were identified in each organism, including previously unrecognised forms. the vast majority of kelch-repeat domains are predicted to form six-bladed \u03b2-propellers. the most prevalent domain architecture in the metazoan animal genomes studied was the btb/ kelch domain organisation and we uncovered 3 subgroups of human btb/kelch proteins. sequence analysis of the kelch-repeat domains of the most robustly-related subgroups identified differences in \u03b2-propeller organisation that could provide direction for experimental study of protein-binding characteristics. conclusion: the kelch-repeat superfamily constitutes a distinct and evolutionarily-widespread family of \u03b2-propeller domain-containing proteins. expansion of the family during the evolution of multicellular animals is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the btb/kelch domain architecture. btb/kelch proteins constitute 72 % of the kelch-repeat superfamily of h. sapiens and form three subgroups, one of which appears the most-conserved during evolution. distinctions in propeller blade organisation between subgroups 1 and 2 were identified that could provide new direction for biochemical and functional studies of novel kelch-repeat proteins. \u00a9 2003 prag and adams; licensee biomed central ltd.",

        "abstracttext": "conservation of gene order in vertebrates is evident after hundreds of millions of years of divergence, but comparisons of the arabidopsis thaliana sequence to partial gene orders of other angiosperms (flowering plants) sharing common ancestry \u223c170-235 million years ago yield conflicting results. this difference may be largely due to the propensity of angiosperms to undergo chromosomal duplication ('polyploidization') and subsequent gene loss ('diploidization'); these evolutionary mechanisms have profound consequences for comparative biology. here we integrate a phylogenetic approach (relating chromosomal duplications to the tree of life) with a genomic approach (mitigating information lost to diploidization) to show that a genome-wide duplication post-dates the divergence of arabidopsis from most dicots. we also show that an inferred ancestral gene order for arabidopsis reveals more synteny with other dicots (exemplified by cotton), and that additional, more ancient duplication events affect more distant taxonomic comparisons. by using partial sequence data for many diverse taxa to better relate the evolutionary history of completely sequenced genomes to the tree of life, we foster comparative approaches to the study of genome organization, consequences of polyploidy, and the molecular basis of quantitative traits.",

        "abstracttext": "the isolation of genes of agronomic interest such as disease resistance genes is a central issue in wheat research. a good knowledge of the organization and evolution of the genome can greatly help in defining the best strategies for efficient gene isolation. so far, very few wheat disease resistance loci have been studied at the molecular level and little is known about their evolution during polyploidization and domestication. in this study, we have analyzed the haplotype structure at loci orthologous to the leaf rust resistance locus lr10 in hexaploid wheat which spans 350 kb in diploid wheat. two haplotypes (h1, h2) were defined by the presence (h1) or the absence (h2) of two different resistance gene analogs (rga1, rga2) at this locus on chromosome ias. both haplotypes were found in a collection of 113 wild and cultivated diploid and polyploid wheat lines and they do not reflect phylogenetic relationships. this indicates an ancient origin for this disease resistance locus and the independent conservation of the two haplotypes throughout the evolution of the wheat genome. finally, the coding regions of the h1 haplotype rgas are extremely conserved in all the species. this suggests a selective pressure for maintaining the structural and functional configuration of this haplotype in wheat. electronic supplementary material to this paper can be obtained by using the springer link server located at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-002-0051-9. \u00a9 springer-verlag 2002.",

        "abstracttext": "aluminum is one of the major factors that affect plant development in acid soils, causing a substantial reduction in yield in many crops. in south america, about 66% of the land surface is made up of acid soils where high aluminum saturation is one of the main limiting factors for agriculture. the biochemical and molecular basis of aluminum tolerance in plants is far from being completely understood despite a growing number of studies, and in the specific case of sugarcane there are virtually no reports on the effects of gene regulation on aluminum stress. the objective of the work presented in this paper was to prospect the sugarcane expressed sequence tag (sucest) data bank for sugarcane genes related to several biochemical pathways known to be involved in the responses to aluminum toxicity in other plant species and yeast. sugarcane genes similar to most of these genes were found, including those coding for enzymes that alleviate oxidative stress or combat infection by pathogens and those which code for proteins responsible for the release of organic acids and signal transducers. the role of these genes in aluminum tolerance mechanisms is reviewed. due to the high level of genomic conservation in related grasses such as maize, barley, sorghum and sugarcane, these genes may be valuable tools which will help us to better understand and to manipulate aluminum tolerance in these species.",

        "abstracttext": "polyadenylation of nucleus-encoded transcripts has a well-defined role in gene expression. the extent and function of polyadenylation in organelles and prokaryotic systems, however, are less well documented. recent reports of polyadenylation-mediated rna destabilization in escherichia coli and in vascular plant chloroplasts prompted us to look for polyadenylation in plant mitochondria. here, we report the use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to map multiple polyadenylate addition sites in maize mitochondrial cox2 transcripts. the lack of sequence conservation surrounding these sites suggests that polyadenylation may occur at many 3' termini created by endoribonucleolytic and/or exoribonucleolytic activities, including those activities involved in 3' end maturation. endogenous transcripts could be efficiently polyadenylated in vitro by using maize mitochondrial lysates with an activity that added amp more efficiently than gmp. polyadenylated substrates were tested for stability in maize mitochondrial s100 extracts, and we found that, compared with nonpolyadenylated rnas, the polyadenylated substrates were less stable. taken together with the low abundance of polyadenylated rnas in maize mitochondria, our results are consistent with a degradation-related process. the fact that polyadenylation does not dramatically destabilize plant mitochondrial transcripts, at least in vitro, is in agreement with results obtained for animal mitochondria but differs from those obtained for chloroplasts and e. coli. because fully edited, partially edited, and unedited transcripts were found among the cloned polyadenylated cox2 cdnas, we conclude that rna editing and polyadenylation are independent processes in maize mitochondria.",

        "abstracttext": "a method for the development of consensus genetic markers between species of the same taxonomic family is described in this paper. it is based on the conservation of the peptide sequences and on the potential polymorphism within non-coding sequences. six loci sequenced from arabidopsis thaliana, ag, lfy3, ap3, fad7, fad3, and adh, were analysed for one ecotype of a. thaliana, four lines of brassica napus, and one line for each parental species, brassica oleracea and brassica rapa. positive amplifications with the degenerate primers showed one band for a. thaliana, two to four bands in rapeseed, and one to two bands in the parental species. direct sequencing of the pcr products confirms their peptide similarity with the 'mother' sequence. by comparison of intron sequences, the correspondence between each rapeseed gene and its homologue in one of the parental species can be determined without ambiguity. another important result is the presence of a polymorphism inside these fragments between the rapeseed lines. this variability could generally be detected by differences of electrophoretic migration on long nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. this method enables a quick and easy shuttle between a. thaliana and brassica species without cloning.",

        "abstracttext": "plant hybrid zones are dynamic centers of ecological and evolutionary processes for plants and their associated communities. studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. in an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5%) resistant, 35 (23%) additive, 35 (23%) dominant, and 32 (21%) showed no response to hybridization. thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. these studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., f1's vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) as a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) the communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) the effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. the indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in 'apparent' herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. three predictions are made: (1) intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas f1 sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids. (3) although susceptible hybrids are likely to support the greatest biodiversity, the impacts of hybridization on keystone species will be crucial in determining the overall effect.",

        "abstracttext": "a cdna encoding a dna-binding protein of the dof class of transcription factors was isolated from a barley endosperm library. the deduced amino acid sequence for the corresponding protein is 94% identical through the dof domain to the prolamin-box (p-box) binding factor pbf from maize. the gene encoding the barley pbf (bpbf) maps to chromosome 7h, and its expression is restricted to the endosperm where it precedes that of the hordein genes. the bpbf expressed in bacteria as a gst-fusion binds a p-box 5'-tgtaaag-3' containing oligonucleotide derived from the promoter region of an hor2 gene. binding was prevented when the p-box motif was mutated to 5'tgtagac-3'. a p-box binding activity, present in barley and wheat endosperm nuclei, interacted similarly to bpbf with this synthetic oligonucleotide, and the binding was abolished by 1,10-phenanthroline. transient expression experiments in developing barley endosperms demonstrate that bpbf transactivates transcription from the p-box element of a native hor2 promoter and that direct binding of bpbf to its target site is essential for transactivation since mutations in the dof dna-binding domain or in the p-box motif of this promoter abolished both binding and transactivation. evidence was also obtained for the presence in wheat of a pbf homologue having similar dna-binding properties to that of bpbf. these results strongly implicate this endosperm-specific dof protein from barley as an important activator of hordein gene expression and suggest the evolutionary conservation of the pbf gene function among small grain cereals.",

        "abstracttext": "dna markers and genetic maps will be important tools for direct investigations of several facets of crop improvement and will provide vital links between plant breeding and basic plant biology. the markers and maps will become more important for increased crop production because plant genetics will be required to extend or replace extant management practices such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation (lee, 1995). despite the importance of the sorghum crop, comprehensive genetic characterization has been limited. therefore, the primary goal of this research program was to develop basic genetic tools to facilitate research in the genetics and breeding of sorghum. the first phase of this project consisted of constructing a genetic map based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps). the isu sorghum map was created through linkage analysis of 78 f2 plants of an intraspecific cross between inbred ck60 and accession p1229828 (pereira et al., 1994). the map consists of 201 loci distributed among 10 linkage groups covering 1,299 cm. comparison of sorghum and maize rflp maps on the basis of common sets of dna probes revealed a high degree of conservation as reflected by homology, copy number, and collinearity. examples of conserved and rearranged locus orders were observed. the same sorghum population was used to map genetic factors (mutants and qtl) for several traits including vegetative and reproductive morphology, maturity, insect, and disease resistance. this presentation will emphasize analysis of genetic factors affecting plant height, an important character for sorghum adaptation in temperate latitudes for grain production. four qtl for plant height were identified in a sample of 152 f2 plants (pereira and lee, 1995) whereas 6 qtl were detected among their f3 progeny. these observations and assessments of other traits at 4 qtl common to f2 plants and their f3 progeny indicate some of these regions correspond to loci (dw) previously identified on the basis of alleles with highly qualitative effects. four of the six sorghum plant height qtl seem to be orthologous to plant height qtl in maize. other possible instances of orthologous qtl included regions for maturity and tillering. these observations suggest that the conservation of the maize and sorghum genomes encompasses sequence homology, collinearity, and function. the genetic information and technology developed on the basis of dna markers could be used in several facets of breeding, genetics, and other basic biological investigations. in addition, dna markers have been used to survey large collections of elite sorghum germ plasm to determine the degree of genetic relationships and genetic diversity (ahnert et al., 1996). rflp data seem to portray genetic relationships more accurately than the methods based exclusively on the coancestry coefficient. this information provides the basis for more accurate perceptions of genetic relationships and diversity.",

        "abstracttext": "many human activities affect genetic structure either by markedly altering (usually decreasing) the level of genetic diversity, or by causing large changes in specific allele frequencies. the former changes are due to such stochastic evolutionary forces as reduced population size, increased migration and recombination, and the latter changes are due to systematic selection pressure. the leading examples of each are habitat destruction and environmental degradation. interaction between stochastic and deterministic evolution is well displayed by introduced colonizing weeds. to combat unwanted evolutionary changes in plant population genetic structure, conservation measures should employ sampling strategies that meet both stochastic and systematic needs. -from author",
