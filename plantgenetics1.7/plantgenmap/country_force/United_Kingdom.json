                "abstracttext": "the greatest challenge to the modern plant systematist is the interpretation of molecular phylogenies that do not correspond to previous classifications based on morphological data. characters that on first appearance seem highly diagnostic are brought into focus by phylogeny and frequently shown to have evolved multiple times independently. parallelism is usually neglected in such systematic studies and the homoplastic distribution of a character in a phylogeny is commonly accredited to convergent evolution. the impact of parallel evolution on angiosperm systematics is examined here using a taxonomically complex and species-rich group of tropical tree genera (myrcia, marlierea, calyptranthes; myrtaceae) as a case study. these groups are traditionally distinguished by flower characters and have been shown to be polyphyletic by molecular data. floral ontogeny of distinct lineages is examined using sem and plotted on a five gene phylogenetic hypothesis to estimate ancestral states and phylogenetic signal for developmental variation. results show that floral characters responsible for taxonomic confusion are a result of both parallel evolution and convergence. this is contrasted with other diverse and taxonomically complex angiosperm groups and problematic taxonomy appears linked to recent diversification events where the same genetic basis remains latent, demonstrating parallelism to be an important factor in problematic taxonomies. in this study, variations in early stage floral development produce the most labile characters. this is discussed in light of ontogenetic patterns in angiosperms with focus on the evolutionary consequences of homoplastic variation during early vs late floral development. the prevalence of parallelism must be appreciated by taxonomists of complex groups. future classifications of groups affected by parallelism are likely to require data from detailed, multi-disciplinary studies of key characters to interpret phylogenies correctly. \u00a9 2016 elsevier gmbh",

                "abstracttext": "one of the important antiviral genetic strategies used in crop breeding is recessive resistance. two eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e family genes, eif4e and eifiso4e, are the most common recessive resistance genes whose absence inhibits infection by plant viruses in potyviridae, carmovirus, and cucumovirus. here, we show that another eif4e family gene, ncbp, acts as a novel recessive resistance gene in arabidopsis thaliana toward plant viruses in alpha- and betaflexiviridae. we found that infection by plantago asiatica mosaic virus (plamv), a potexvirus, was delayed in ncbp mutants of a. thaliana. virus replication efficiency did not differ between an ncbp mutant and a wild type plant in single cells, but viral cell-to-cell movement was significantly delayed in the ncbp mutant. furthermore, the accumulation of triple-gene-block protein 2 (tgb2) and tgb3, the movement proteins of potexviruses, decreased in the ncbp mutant. inoculation experiments with several viruses showed that the accumulation of viruses encoding tgbs in their genomes decreased in the ncbp mutant. these results indicate that ncbp is a novel member of the eif4e family recessive resistance genes whose loss impairs viral cell-to-cell movement by inhibiting the efficient accumulation of tgb2 and tgb3. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",

                "abstracttext": "background ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) is the chloroplast enzyme that fixes co2 in photosynthesis, but the enzyme also fixes o2, which leads to the wasteful photorespiratory pathway. if we better understand the structure-function relationship of the enzyme, we might be able to engineer improvements. when the crystal structure of chlamydomonas rubisco was solved, four new posttranslational modifications were observed which are not present in other species. the modifications were 4-hydroxylation of the conserved pro-104 and 151 residues, and s-methylation of the variable cys-256 and 369 residues, which are phe-256 and val-369 in land plants. because the modifications were only observed in chlamydomonas rubisco, they might account for the differences in kinetic properties between the algal and plant enzymes. methods site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation have been used to test the essentiality of these modifications by replacing each of the residues with alanine (ala). biochemical analyses were done to determine the specificity factors and kinetic constants. results replacing the modified-residues in chlamydomonas rubisco affected the enzyme's catalytic activity. substituting hydroxy-pro-104 and methyl-cys-256 with alanine influenced rubisco catalysis. conclusion this is the first study on these posttranslationally-modified residues in rubisco by genetic engineering. as these forms of modifications/regulation are not available in plants, the modified residues could be a means to modulate rubisco activity. general significance with a better understanding of rubisco structure-function, we can define targets for improving the enzyme. \u00a9 2016 elsevier b.v.",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "genetically engineered crops with insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis (bt) have been planted in the world for two decades, aiming to control some major insect pests. while the bt-crop strategy has been generally successful, a potential risk is the evolution of insect resistance to bt crops. modeling has been one of the main approaches to assessing the risk. to date, however, the importance of spatial heterogeneity in small-holder farm systems has not been adequately addressed. to address the question we developed and analyzed a spatially explicit model of insect population dynamics and genetics in which the proportion of bt crops (pbt) is spatially heterogeneous (hd) or homogeneous (ud). we found that in both single- and two-locus models, the time it takes for insect to evolve regional resistance (ttr) varies among different hd patterns. the ttr could differ considerably between the case of hd and that of ud, depending on both spatial and non-spatial conditions. under some conditions, regional evolution of resistance was much faster in the case of hd than in the case of ud. the difference between the two cases was caused by gene spread from hotspots of resistant alleles where the local pbt is much higher than average. our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of pbt may significantly affect the speed of regional resistance and therefore is an important factor that should be taken into account for quantitative predictions as well as for design of resistance management strategies. \u00a9 2017 elsevier b.v.",

                "abstracttext": "while cocoa plants regenerated from cryopreserved somatic embryos can demonstrate high levels of phenotypic variability, little is known about the sources of the observed variability. previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. to achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using methylation sensitive amplified polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in ln. furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible. the outcome of this study indicates that the cryopreservation induced phenotypic variability could be, at least partially, due to dna methylation changes. key message: phenotypic variability observed in cryostored cocoa somatic-embryos is epigenetic in nature. this variability is partially reversible, not stochastic in nature but a directed response to the in-vitro culture and cryopreservation. \u00a9 2016 adu-gyamfi et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "a collection of 102 diaporthe isolates was compiled from lesions on carrot, parsley and wild apiaceae species in france from 2010 to 2014. molecular typing based on its rdna sequences resulted in the identification of 85 d.\u00a0angelicae and 17 d.\u00a0eres isolates. based on sequences of the 3\u2032 part of the igs rdna, intraspecific variability was analysed for 17 d.\u00a0angelicae and 13 d.\u00a0eres isolates from diverse plant species, locations in france, and plant tissues. the genetic diversity was greater for d.\u00a0angelicae isolates than d.\u00a0eres isolates. in vitro sensitivity of five d.\u00a0angelicae and four d.\u00a0eres isolates to each of nine fungicides was similar for isolates of both species, with a marked variation in fungicide sensitivity depending on the active ingredient. to assess the pathogenicity of d.\u00a0angelicae and d.\u00a0eres isolates on carrot, one isolate of each species was inoculated onto umbels in a controlled environment. typical lesions were observed for both isolates. carrot crop debris collected from a seed production field in france and placed in controlled conditions produced perithecia and ascospores typical of diaporthe, that were further characterized molecularly as belonging to d.\u00a0angelicae. detection of diaporthe species on seed lots from three carrot production fields in france was investigated. both species were detected on seeds by conventional pcr assay, with a greater frequency for d.\u00a0angelicae than d.\u00a0eres (67% vs 33%, respectively). overall, the results highlighted that umbel browning in carrot seed crops in france was mainly caused by d.\u00a0angelicae. \u00a9 2016 british society for plant pathology",

                "abstracttext": "the greatest challenge to the modern plant systematist is the interpretation of molecular phylogenies that do not correspond to previous classifications based on morphological data. characters that on first appearance seem highly diagnostic are brought into focus by phylogeny and frequently shown to have evolved multiple times independently. parallelism is usually neglected in such systematic studies and the homoplastic distribution of a character in a phylogeny is commonly accredited to convergent evolution. the impact of parallel evolution on angiosperm systematics is examined here using a taxonomically complex and species-rich group of tropical tree genera (myrcia, marlierea, calyptranthes; myrtaceae) as a case study. these groups are traditionally distinguished by flower characters and have been shown to be polyphyletic by molecular data. floral ontogeny of distinct lineages is examined using sem and plotted on a five gene phylogenetic hypothesis to estimate ancestral states and phylogenetic signal for developmental variation. results show that floral characters responsible for taxonomic confusion are a result of both parallel evolution and convergence. this is contrasted with other diverse and taxonomically complex angiosperm groups and problematic taxonomy appears linked to recent diversification events where the same genetic basis remains latent, demonstrating parallelism to be an important factor in problematic taxonomies. in this study, variations in early stage floral development produce the most labile characters. this is discussed in light of ontogenetic patterns in angiosperms with focus on the evolutionary consequences of homoplastic variation during early vs late floral development. the prevalence of parallelism must be appreciated by taxonomists of complex groups. future classifications of groups affected by parallelism are likely to require data from detailed, multi-disciplinary studies of key characters to interpret phylogenies correctly. \u00a9 2016 elsevier gmbh",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "one concern in the ongoing debate over the conservation status of mahogany has been the possibility that selective logging, as a form of negative phenotypic selection, might have led to deterioration in the genetic quality of populations. the incidence and degree of such 'dysgenic' effects is discussed, based on a consideration of mahogany logging practices, their expected genetic effects and empirical data on phenotypic selection in forest trees. loggers have tended to avoid diseased, small, very large and poorly-formed individuals, and consequently logging has tended to increase the proportion of poor quality phenotypes relative to that before logging; in at least some conditions, selection differentials have been strongly negative. however, the upper limit for heritability of logger-selected traits in naturally-regenerated mahogany is probably no more than c. 0.1. consequently, and assuming relatively extreme but realistic negative selection differentials of 50%, the maximum negative dysgenic response to a single logging-mediated phenotypic selection event is expected to be relatively small, i.e. \u22645%. this expectation is consistent with the empirical information from mahogany and other taxa. the implications of any dysgenic effects depend very much on the use and the future of dysgenically-selected populations. in managed populations, dysgenic effects could be reversed through positive selection. in the case of exploited but currently unmanaged natural populations, dysgenic selection is primarily of importance insofar as it affects fitness. as a threat to mahogany conservation and long-term sustainable production, it is probably insignificant in comparison with other genetic and non-genetic factors. \u00a9 2005 foundation for environmental conservation.",
