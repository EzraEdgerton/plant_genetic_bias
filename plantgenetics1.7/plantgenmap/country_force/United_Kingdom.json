                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "oceanic archipelagos are typically rich in endemic taxa, because they offer ideal conditions for diversification and speciation in isolation. one of the most remarkable evolutionary radiations on the canary islands comprises the 16 species included in limonium subsection nobiles, all of which are subject to diverse threats, and legally protected. since many of them are single-island endemics limited to one or a few populations, there exists a risk that a loss of genetic variation might limit their long-term survival. in this study, we used eight newly developed microsatellite markers to characterize the levels of genetic variation and inbreeding in l. macrophyllum, a species endemic to the north-east of tenerife that belongs to limonium subsection nobiles. we detected generally low levels of genetic variation over all populations (ht = 0.363), and substantial differentiation among populations (fst = 0.188; rst = 0.186) coupled with a negligible degree of inbreeding (f = 0.042). obligate outcrossing may have maintained l. macrophyllum relatively unaffected by inbreeding despite the species\u2019 limited dispersal ability and the genetic bottlenecks likely caused by a prolonged history of grazing. although several factors still constitute a risk for the conservation of l. macrophyllum, the lack of inbreeding and the recent positive demographic trends observed in the populations of this species are factors that favour its future persistence. \u00a9 2017, springer international publishing switzerland.",

                "abstracttext": "whitebark pine (wbp, pinus albicaulis engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (wpbr, caused by cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae). information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. however, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for wbp. in this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from wbp breeding programs in western north america. rna-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the wbp needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous snps (ns-snps). following the annotation of genes with ns-snps, 216 ns-snps within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design snp arrays for high-throughput genotyping. among these snp loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from british columbia (canada), oregon and washington (usa). a clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the wbp breeding populations. genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of wpbr disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of wbp genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to wpbr. the wbp genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines. \u00a9 this is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. the work is made available under the creative commons cc0 public domain dedication.",

                "abstracttext": "coral reefs are major contributors to marine biodiversity. however, they are in rapid decline due to global environmental changes such as rising sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and pollution. genomic and transcriptomic analyses have broadened our understanding of coral biology, but a study of the microrna (mirna) repertoire of corals is missing. mirnas constitute a class of small non-coding rnas of \u223c22 nt in size that play crucial roles in development, metabolism, and stress response in plants and animals alike. in this study, we examined the coral stylophora pistillata for the presence of mirnas and the corresponding core protein machinery required for their processing and function. based on small rna sequencing, we present evidence for 31 bona fide micrornas, 5 of which (mir-100, mir-2022, mir-2023, mir-2030, and mir-2036) are conserved in other metazoans. homologues of argonaute, piwi, dicer, drosha, pasha, and hen1 were identified in the transcriptome of s. pistillata based on strong sequence conservation with known rnai proteins, with additional support derived from phylogenetic trees. examination of putative mirna gene targets indicates potential roles in development, metabolism, immunity, and biomineralisation for several of the micrornas. here, we present first evidence of a functional rnai machinery and five conserved mirnas in s. pistillata , implying that mirnas play a role in organismal biology of scleractinian corals. analysis of predicted mirna target genes in s. pistillata suggests potential roles of mirnas in symbiosis and coral calcification. given the importance of mirnas in regulating gene expression in other metazoans, further expression analyses of small non-coding rnas in transcriptional studies of corals should be informative about mirna-affected processes and pathways. \u00a9 2014 liew et al.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "over the past decade, a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry, centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade. accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous san and khoi have also launched demands\u2014to date unmet\u2014for a stake in rooibos benefits. meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. all remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the south african apartheid system. the melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as \u201cthe mother\u201d and \u201ctesting ground\u201d of so-called access and benefit sharing. such approaches stem in part from the convention on biological diversity and its nagoya protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. with growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach. \u00a9 2016 saab",

                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "whitebark pine (wbp, pinus albicaulis engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (wpbr, caused by cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae). information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. however, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for wbp. in this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from wbp breeding programs in western north america. rna-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the wbp needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous snps (ns-snps). following the annotation of genes with ns-snps, 216 ns-snps within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design snp arrays for high-throughput genotyping. among these snp loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from british columbia (canada), oregon and washington (usa). a clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the wbp breeding populations. genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of wpbr disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of wbp genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to wpbr. the wbp genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines. \u00a9 this is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. the work is made available under the creative commons cc0 public domain dedication.",

                "abstracttext": "coral reefs are major contributors to marine biodiversity. however, they are in rapid decline due to global environmental changes such as rising sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and pollution. genomic and transcriptomic analyses have broadened our understanding of coral biology, but a study of the microrna (mirna) repertoire of corals is missing. mirnas constitute a class of small non-coding rnas of \u223c22 nt in size that play crucial roles in development, metabolism, and stress response in plants and animals alike. in this study, we examined the coral stylophora pistillata for the presence of mirnas and the corresponding core protein machinery required for their processing and function. based on small rna sequencing, we present evidence for 31 bona fide micrornas, 5 of which (mir-100, mir-2022, mir-2023, mir-2030, and mir-2036) are conserved in other metazoans. homologues of argonaute, piwi, dicer, drosha, pasha, and hen1 were identified in the transcriptome of s. pistillata based on strong sequence conservation with known rnai proteins, with additional support derived from phylogenetic trees. examination of putative mirna gene targets indicates potential roles in development, metabolism, immunity, and biomineralisation for several of the micrornas. here, we present first evidence of a functional rnai machinery and five conserved mirnas in s. pistillata , implying that mirnas play a role in organismal biology of scleractinian corals. analysis of predicted mirna target genes in s. pistillata suggests potential roles of mirnas in symbiosis and coral calcification. given the importance of mirnas in regulating gene expression in other metazoans, further expression analyses of small non-coding rnas in transcriptional studies of corals should be informative about mirna-affected processes and pathways. \u00a9 2014 liew et al.",
