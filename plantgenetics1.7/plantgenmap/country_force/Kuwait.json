                "abstracttext": "jordan is a small country located in the fertile crescent region and is very rich in plant taxa due to the variability of its bio-geographical regions and ecosystems. plant diversity in jordan is at risk due to demographic reasons, land use problems, human and environmental stressors. the objective of this research was to evaluate the fl oral diversity in different ecosystems in jordan (al-shoubak, al-tafileh, madaba and al-mafraq governorates) with special concern given to artemisia herba alba diversity. artemisia herba alba is an endangered medicinal plant species. the transect-quadrate method was used and three sites were examined within each governorate. the collected data were analyzed statistically and descriptively. statistical analysis did not show evidence of association between the governorate elevation and species diversity indices. no statistical significant variability in species diversity indices among governorates were found. however, shannon diversity index, evenness, relative density, species density and richness were different among locations. the species density was the highest in madaba (36 plants/ m2) and the lowest was in tafileh (21 plants/m2). but tafileh showed the highest shannon diversity index, species richness and evenness. shoubak showed the highest density of artemisia herba alba along with frequency and relative frequency. shoubak ecosystem considered the best of those studied for growing and maintaining this plant. mafraq showed the lowest shannon diversity, species evenness and density of artemisia herba alba. this indicates that this region is intensively disturbed and conservation efforts are urgent to maintain its species and genetic diversity. managing the collection of artemisia herba alba and adoption of domestication programs will conserve it, specifically in mafraq region. \u00a9 2016, national centre for agrarian sciences. all rights reserved.",
