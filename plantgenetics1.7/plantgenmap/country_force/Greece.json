                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "here we present the results of a multiple organizational level analysis conceived to identify acclimative/adaptive strategies exhibited by the seagrass posidonia oceanica to the daily fluctuations in the light environment, at contrasting depths. we assessed changes in photophysiological parameters, leaf respiration, pigments, and protein and mrna expression levels. the results show that the diel oscillations of p. oceanica photophysiological and respiratory responses were related to transcripts and proteins expression of the genes involved in those processes and that there was a response asynchrony between shallow and deep plants probably caused by the strong differences in the light environment. the photochemical pathway of energy use was more effective in shallow plants due to higher light availability, but these plants needed more investment in photoprotection and photorepair, requiring higher translation and protein synthesis than deep plants. the genetic differentiation between deep and shallow stands suggests the existence of locally adapted genotypes to contrasting light environments. the depth-specific diel rhythms of photosynthetic and respiratory processes, from molecular to physiological levels, must be considered in the management and conservation of these key coastal ecosystems. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",

                "abstracttext": "dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l., lamiaceae) is a well-known aromatic and medicinal mediterranean plant that is native in coastal regions of the western balkan and southern apennine peninsulas and is commonly cultivated worldwide. it is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. knowledge of its genetic diversity and spatiotemporal patterns is important for plant breeding programmes and conservation. we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivated/naturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula. the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivated/naturalised groups, with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area. most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations, although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance. geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis, with three sub-clusters of indigenous populations. the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast, while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula. the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary trajectories: 1) the species survived in the glacial refugium in southern adriatic coastal region with subsequent colonization events towards northern, eastern and southern balkan peninsula; 2) species survived in several refugia exhibiting concurrent divergence into three genetic groups. the insight into genetic diversity and structure also provide the baseline data for conservation of s. officinalis genetic resources valuable for future breeding programmes. \u00a9 2016 re\u0161etnik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "over the last 200. years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (r&d). transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. the oldest form of r&d, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. international provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. the situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. the implementation of the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (abs) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for r&d purposes. many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning abs regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. this is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating r&d. \u00a9 2014 the authors.",
