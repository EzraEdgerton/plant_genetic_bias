                "abstracttext": "populations of the large-flowered sandwort (arenaria grandiflora l.) in the fontainebleau forest (france) have declined rapidly during the last century. despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. the low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore fontainebleau populations. consequently, a. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the fontainebleau forest in 1999. each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. after establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. at present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil ph and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. this introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. to understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. from these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation. \u00a9 2013 maurice et al.",

                "abstracttext": "a collection of 102 diaporthe isolates was compiled from lesions on carrot, parsley and wild apiaceae species in france from 2010 to 2014. molecular typing based on its rdna sequences resulted in the identification of 85 d.\u00a0angelicae and 17 d.\u00a0eres isolates. based on sequences of the 3\u2032 part of the igs rdna, intraspecific variability was analysed for 17 d.\u00a0angelicae and 13 d.\u00a0eres isolates from diverse plant species, locations in france, and plant tissues. the genetic diversity was greater for d.\u00a0angelicae isolates than d.\u00a0eres isolates. in vitro sensitivity of five d.\u00a0angelicae and four d.\u00a0eres isolates to each of nine fungicides was similar for isolates of both species, with a marked variation in fungicide sensitivity depending on the active ingredient. to assess the pathogenicity of d.\u00a0angelicae and d.\u00a0eres isolates on carrot, one isolate of each species was inoculated onto umbels in a controlled environment. typical lesions were observed for both isolates. carrot crop debris collected from a seed production field in france and placed in controlled conditions produced perithecia and ascospores typical of diaporthe, that were further characterized molecularly as belonging to d.\u00a0angelicae. detection of diaporthe species on seed lots from three carrot production fields in france was investigated. both species were detected on seeds by conventional pcr assay, with a greater frequency for d.\u00a0angelicae than d.\u00a0eres (67% vs 33%, respectively). overall, the results highlighted that umbel browning in carrot seed crops in france was mainly caused by d.\u00a0angelicae. \u00a9 2016 british society for plant pathology",
