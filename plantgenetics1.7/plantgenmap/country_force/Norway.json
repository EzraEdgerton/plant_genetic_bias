                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",
