                "abstracttext": "anthracnose caused by colletotrichum spp. is one of main strawberry diseases worldwide. the disease recently arrived in iran and become epidemic in the kurdistan province. a combination of morphological, molecular and pathogen-host interaction approaches (referred to the consolidated species concept) were applied to isolates from symptomatic strawberry tissues collected in iran. multi-gene phylogenetic analysis based on its-rdna, beta-tubulin (tub2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) identified the species as the s5 clade of colletotrichum nymphaeae. no significant intraspecies variation was observed in terms of morphology and pathogenicity. no significant genetic variation was observed among the isolates using inter simple sequence repeat analysis (issr) and primer pair combination of eric1/box and eric2/box fingerprinting markers. based on the results of this study, it can be postulated that the c. nymphaeae population in iran established itself from a single origin due to a founder effect. more generally, molecular dating based on relaxed clocks indicates co-radiation of c. nymphaeae s5 and strawberry plants and suggests high reciprocal specificity between the host and pathogen. \u00a9 2016, koninklijke nederlandse planteziektenkundige vereniging.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the knowledge of the genetic architecture of closely related species and/or populations of a single species can be very useful to shed light on the processes that led to their current distributions. the present study provides a preliminary evaluation of the conservation status of the populations of cryptotaenia thomasii, a very narrow endemic species occurring in southern italy. previous studies showed that c. thomasii was phylogenetically closely related to c. flahaultii, endemic species of caucasus, and to evaluate its conservation status and the genetic variability of plant species the internal transcribed spacers (itss) of nuclear ribosomal dna were sequenced and the snps were analyzed. results: the restriction analysis of nrdna with the restriction enzymes allowed to detect the presence of two single mutations (snps) among the sequences of two species. our molecular analysis pointed out that c. thomasii and c. flahaultii, in spite of their geographical disjunction, show a sign of an ancient contact as an extreme case of geographical disjunction italian-caucasus. conclusion: from the evolutionary history of the species and its distribution pattern one can reconstruct a possible scenario with some hypotheses that explain the hypothetical ancestral area where the two species were in contact. we speculate the two species may have originated from fragmentation of a common ancestor widespread in the western palearctic zone and have survived in two separated refuge areas limited by important mountain systems. this hypothesis is supported by our molecular analysis, in fact, the analysis of snps showed that some c. thomasii populations retain the signs of an ancient link with c. flahaultii. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",
