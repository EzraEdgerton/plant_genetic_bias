                "abstracttext": "nuphar submersa (nymphaeaceae) is a critically endangered freshwater macrophyte indigenous to central japan, with only four small extant populations represented across its entire range. we investigated the genotypic and genetic diversity as well as the genetic structure of all extant individuals of n. submersa based on analysis of 15 microsatellite loci. among 278 individual ramets, 52 multilocus genotypes were detected: 30 genotypes in nikko city (nik), 18 in nasukarasuyama city (nas), 3 in mooka city (mok), and 1 in sakura city (sak). the average number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.20 to 1.93, whereas the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.11 to 0.33 and from 0.10 to 0.24, respectively. with the exception of sak, all populations contained multiple clones, but our results indicated low levels of within-population genetic diversity. the populations nik and nas comprised few large or middle-sized genets and many small genets. the populations nik and nas were suggested to comprise large old, old fragmented, and/or young small genets resulting from seedling establishment. all four populations were differentiated, and gene flow between the populations was restricted (average level of gene flow (nm)\u00a0=\u00a00.122, g\u2019st =\u00a00.639). of the total genetic diversity, 67.20 and 9.13% were attributable to inter- and intra-population diversity, respectively. structure analysis revealed two or three well-differentiated groups of populations. cluster i comprised one population (nik) and cluster ii comprised the remaining populations at k\u00a0=\u00a02. the populations nik, nas, and the remaining populations were assigned to clusters i, ii, and iii, respectively, at k\u00a0=\u00a03. for conservation practices, we recommend that each cluster be regarded as a different management unit. we further suggest that artificial gene flow among mok and sak populations is an appropriate option, whereas nik should not be reinforced with genotypes from the remaining populations. \u00a9 2016, the botanical society of japan and springer japan.",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the potential of constructed wetlands (cws) as a low technology for wastewater treatment is timely but there is a need to understand the route of pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp.) and indicator organisms (enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli) present in wastewater within those systems and to what extent they can compromise the further use of the plants (enabling in-house ornamental use) and water reuse (irrigation purposes). in the present study the fate of potential pathogenic bacteria within a cw, with ornamental plants, and an outlet pond established in a tourism house for wastewater treatment was assessed. the fate of pathogenic bacteria in lettuce, both plant tissues and soil, subject to irrigation with water contaminated either with l. monocytogenes or e. coli (indicator organism) was investigated. the uptake of indicator organisms by the cw ornamental plants was low and there was a decrease, from the cw wastewater inlet to the outlet, of up to 3 log for enterobacteriaceae and up to 2 log for e. coli. concerning salmonella spp. no detection was registered in the water, plant tissues or substrate within the cw. on the other hand, several l. monocytogenes isolates were retrieved from water, root and substrate samples, found to have a high susceptibility to a battery of antibiotics. the irrigation of lettuce with water containing pathogenic bacteria (l. monocytogenes) and indicator organisms (e. coli) must be considered with caution since both bacteria were detected in the soil growing media and internalization of l. monocytogenes in roots was observed. these issues are poorly investigated and to our knowledge not addressed in the sphere of cws. \u00a9 2017 elsevier b.v.",

                "abstracttext": "nuphar submersa (nymphaeaceae) is a critically endangered freshwater macrophyte indigenous to central japan, with only four small extant populations represented across its entire range. we investigated the genotypic and genetic diversity as well as the genetic structure of all extant individuals of n. submersa based on analysis of 15 microsatellite loci. among 278 individual ramets, 52 multilocus genotypes were detected: 30 genotypes in nikko city (nik), 18 in nasukarasuyama city (nas), 3 in mooka city (mok), and 1 in sakura city (sak). the average number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.20 to 1.93, whereas the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.11 to 0.33 and from 0.10 to 0.24, respectively. with the exception of sak, all populations contained multiple clones, but our results indicated low levels of within-population genetic diversity. the populations nik and nas comprised few large or middle-sized genets and many small genets. the populations nik and nas were suggested to comprise large old, old fragmented, and/or young small genets resulting from seedling establishment. all four populations were differentiated, and gene flow between the populations was restricted (average level of gene flow (nm)\u00a0=\u00a00.122, g\u2019st =\u00a00.639). of the total genetic diversity, 67.20 and 9.13% were attributable to inter- and intra-population diversity, respectively. structure analysis revealed two or three well-differentiated groups of populations. cluster i comprised one population (nik) and cluster ii comprised the remaining populations at k\u00a0=\u00a02. the populations nik, nas, and the remaining populations were assigned to clusters i, ii, and iii, respectively, at k\u00a0=\u00a03. for conservation practices, we recommend that each cluster be regarded as a different management unit. we further suggest that artificial gene flow among mok and sak populations is an appropriate option, whereas nik should not be reinforced with genotypes from the remaining populations. \u00a9 2016, the botanical society of japan and springer japan.",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",
