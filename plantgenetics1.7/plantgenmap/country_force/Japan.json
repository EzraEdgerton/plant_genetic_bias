                "abstracttext": "the colonization of land by plants shaped the terrestrial biosphere, the geosphere and global climates. the nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. in the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. in the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophyteswere an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. the data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. \u00a9 2016 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the initiation of flowering is tightly regulated by the endogenous and environment signals, which is crucial for the reproductive success of flowering plants. it is well known that autonomous and vernalization pathways repress transcription of flowering locus c (flc), a focal floral repressor, but how its protein stability is regulated remains largely unknown. here, we found that mutations in a novel arabidopsis sumo protease 1 (asp1) resulted in a strong late-flowering phenotype under long-days, but to a lesser extent under short-days. asp1 localizes in the nucleus and exhibited a sumo protease activity in vitro and in vivo. the conserved cys-577 in asp1 is critical for its enzymatic activity, as well as its physiological function in the regulation of flowering time. genetic and gene expression analyses demonstrated that asp1 promotes transcription of positive regulators of flowering, such as ft, soc1 and fd, and may function in both co-dependent photoperiod pathway and flc-dependent pathways. although the transcription level of flc was not affected in the loss-of-function asp1 mutant, the protein stability of flc was increased in the asp1 mutant. taken together, this study identified a novel bona fide sumo protease, asp1, which positively regulates transition to flowering at least partly by repressing flc protein stability. \u00a9 2016 the authors. journal of integrative plant biology published by john wiley & sons australia, ltd on behalf of institute of botany, chinese academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "the colonization of land by plants shaped the terrestrial biosphere, the geosphere and global climates. the nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. in the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. in the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophyteswere an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. the data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. \u00a9 2016 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the initiation of flowering is tightly regulated by the endogenous and environment signals, which is crucial for the reproductive success of flowering plants. it is well known that autonomous and vernalization pathways repress transcription of flowering locus c (flc), a focal floral repressor, but how its protein stability is regulated remains largely unknown. here, we found that mutations in a novel arabidopsis sumo protease 1 (asp1) resulted in a strong late-flowering phenotype under long-days, but to a lesser extent under short-days. asp1 localizes in the nucleus and exhibited a sumo protease activity in vitro and in vivo. the conserved cys-577 in asp1 is critical for its enzymatic activity, as well as its physiological function in the regulation of flowering time. genetic and gene expression analyses demonstrated that asp1 promotes transcription of positive regulators of flowering, such as ft, soc1 and fd, and may function in both co-dependent photoperiod pathway and flc-dependent pathways. although the transcription level of flc was not affected in the loss-of-function asp1 mutant, the protein stability of flc was increased in the asp1 mutant. taken together, this study identified a novel bona fide sumo protease, asp1, which positively regulates transition to flowering at least partly by repressing flc protein stability. \u00a9 2016 the authors. journal of integrative plant biology published by john wiley & sons australia, ltd on behalf of institute of botany, chinese academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",
