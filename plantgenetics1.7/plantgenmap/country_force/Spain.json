                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l., lamiaceae) is a well-known aromatic and medicinal mediterranean plant that is native in coastal regions of the western balkan and southern apennine peninsulas and is commonly cultivated worldwide. it is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. knowledge of its genetic diversity and spatiotemporal patterns is important for plant breeding programmes and conservation. we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivated/naturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula. the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivated/naturalised groups, with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area. most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations, although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance. geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis, with three sub-clusters of indigenous populations. the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast, while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula. the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary trajectories: 1) the species survived in the glacial refugium in southern adriatic coastal region with subsequent colonization events towards northern, eastern and southern balkan peninsula; 2) species survived in several refugia exhibiting concurrent divergence into three genetic groups. the insight into genetic diversity and structure also provide the baseline data for conservation of s. officinalis genetic resources valuable for future breeding programmes. \u00a9 2016 re\u0161etnik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l., lamiaceae) is a well-known aromatic and medicinal mediterranean plant that is native in coastal regions of the western balkan and southern apennine peninsulas and is commonly cultivated worldwide. it is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. knowledge of its genetic diversity and spatiotemporal patterns is important for plant breeding programmes and conservation. we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivated/naturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula. the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivated/naturalised groups, with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area. most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations, although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance. geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis, with three sub-clusters of indigenous populations. the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast, while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula. the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary trajectories: 1) the species survived in the glacial refugium in southern adriatic coastal region with subsequent colonization events towards northern, eastern and southern balkan peninsula; 2) species survived in several refugia exhibiting concurrent divergence into three genetic groups. the insight into genetic diversity and structure also provide the baseline data for conservation of s. officinalis genetic resources valuable for future breeding programmes. \u00a9 2016 re\u0161etnik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
