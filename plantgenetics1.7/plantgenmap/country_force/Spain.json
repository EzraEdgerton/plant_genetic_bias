                "abstracttext": "polyploidy has rarely been documented in rain forest trees but it has recently been found in african species of the genus afzelia (leguminosae), which is composed of four tetraploid rain forest species and two diploid dry forest species. the genus afzelia thus provides an opportunity to examine how and when polyploidy and habitat shift occurred in africa, and whether they are associated. in this study, we combined three plastid markers (psba, trnl, ndhf), two nuclear markers (ribosomal its and the single-copy pepc e7 gene), plastomes (obtained by high throughput sequencing) and morphological traits, with an extensive taxonomic and geographic sampling to explore the evolutionary history of afzelia. both nuclear dna and morphological vegetative characters separated diploid from tetraploid lineages. although the two african diploid species were well differentiated genetically and morphologically, the relationships among the tetraploid species were not resolved. in contrast to the nuclear markers, plastid markers revealed that one of the diploid species forms a well-supported clade with the tetraploids, suggesting historical hybridisation, possibly in relation with genome duplication (polyploidization) and habitat shift from dry to rain forests. molecular dating based on fossil-anchored gene phylogenies indicates that extant afzelia started diverging c. 14.5 or 20 ma while extant tetraploid species started diverging c. 7.0 or 9.4 ma according to plastid and nuclear dna, respectively. additional studies of tropical polyploid plants are needed to assess whether the ploidy-habitat association observed in african afzelia would reflect a role of polyploidization in niche divergence in the tropics. \u00a9 2016 elsevier inc.",

                "abstracttext": "hitherto, most quantitative trait loci of maize growth and biomass yield have been identified for a single time point, usually the final harvest stage. through this approach cumulative effects are detected, without considering genetic factors causing phase-specific differences in growth rates. to assess the genetics of growth dynamics, we employed automated non-invasive phenotyping to monitor the plant sizes of 252 diverse maize inbred lines at 11 different developmental time points; 50 k snp array genotype data were used for genome-wide association mapping and genomic selection. the heritability of biomass was estimated to be over 71%, and the average prediction accuracy amounted to 0.39. using the individual time point data, 12 main effect marker-trait associations (mtas) and six pairs of epistatic interactions were detected that displayed different patterns of expression at various developmental time points. a subset of them also showed significant effects on relative growth rates in different intervals. the detected mtas jointly explained up to 12% of the total phenotypic variation, decreasing with developmental progression. using non-parametric functional mapping and multivariate mapping approaches, four additional marker loci affecting growth dynamics were detected. our results demonstrate that plant biomass accumulation is a complex trait governed by many small effect loci, most of which act at certain restricted developmental phases. this highlights the need for investigation of stage-specific growth affecting genes to elucidate important processes operating at different developmental phases. \u00a9 2016 john wiley & sons ltd and the society for experimental biology.",

                "abstracttext": "fluctuating asymmetry (fa), i.e. small, non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in morphological characters, increases under genetic and/or environmental stress. ecological and evolutionary studies addressing fa became popular in past decades; however, their outcomes remain controversial. the discrepancies might be at least partly explained by inconsistent and non-standardised methodology. our aim was to improve the methodology of these studies by identifying factors that affect the reproducibility of fa measurements in plant leaves. six observers used a highly standardised measurement protocol to measure fa using the width, area and weight of the same set of leaves of 10 plant species that differed in leaf size, shape of the leaf margin and other leaf traits. on average, 24% of the total variation in the data was due to measurement error. reproducibility of measurements varied with the shape of leaf margin, leaf size, the measured character and the experience of the observer. the lowest reproducibility of the width of leaf halves was found for simple leaves with serrate margins and the highest for simple leaves with entire margins and for compound pinnate leaves. the reproducibility was significantly lower for the weight of leaf halves than for either their width or area, especially for plants with small leaves. the reproducibility was also lower for measurements made by experienced observers than by na\u00efve observers. the size of press-dried leaves decreased slightly but significantly relative to fresh leaves, but the fa of press-dried leaves adequately reflected the fa of fresh leaves. in contrast, preservation in 60% ethanol did not affect leaf size, but it decreased the width-based values of fa to 89.3% of the values measured from fresh leaves. we suggest that although reproducibility of leaf fa measurements depends upon many factors, the shape of the leaf margin is the most important source of variation. we recommend, whenever possible, choosing large-leaved plants with entire leaf margins as model objects for studies involving measurements of fa using the width of leaf halves. these measurements should be conducted with high accuracy from images of fresh or press-dried leaves. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "fluctuating asymmetry (fa), i.e. small, non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in morphological characters, increases under genetic and/or environmental stress. ecological and evolutionary studies addressing fa became popular in past decades; however, their outcomes remain controversial. the discrepancies might be at least partly explained by inconsistent and non-standardised methodology. our aim was to improve the methodology of these studies by identifying factors that affect the reproducibility of fa measurements in plant leaves. six observers used a highly standardised measurement protocol to measure fa using the width, area and weight of the same set of leaves of 10 plant species that differed in leaf size, shape of the leaf margin and other leaf traits. on average, 24% of the total variation in the data was due to measurement error. reproducibility of measurements varied with the shape of leaf margin, leaf size, the measured character and the experience of the observer. the lowest reproducibility of the width of leaf halves was found for simple leaves with serrate margins and the highest for simple leaves with entire margins and for compound pinnate leaves. the reproducibility was significantly lower for the weight of leaf halves than for either their width or area, especially for plants with small leaves. the reproducibility was also lower for measurements made by experienced observers than by na\u00efve observers. the size of press-dried leaves decreased slightly but significantly relative to fresh leaves, but the fa of press-dried leaves adequately reflected the fa of fresh leaves. in contrast, preservation in 60% ethanol did not affect leaf size, but it decreased the width-based values of fa to 89.3% of the values measured from fresh leaves. we suggest that although reproducibility of leaf fa measurements depends upon many factors, the shape of the leaf margin is the most important source of variation. we recommend, whenever possible, choosing large-leaved plants with entire leaf margins as model objects for studies involving measurements of fa using the width of leaf halves. these measurements should be conducted with high accuracy from images of fresh or press-dried leaves. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "dispersal ecology is a broad topical discipline that tackles important conceptual and applied issues, such as the study of the ability of plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes. the relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because: (i) dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse (or produce propagules to be dispersed) to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns; (ii) by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry, dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape; and (iii) dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity, such as species assembly in species-rich communities. the steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address conservation issues have expanded the disciplinary boundaries of dispersal ecology. the discussion on the main advances on and challenges for dispersal ecology was the main motivation for the organization of a thematic topic session entitled dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world at the annual meeting of the british ecological society (2015, edinburgh). this session brought together researchers with different types of expertise and interests on dispersal processes and their contributions are now included in this special feature together with a few additional articles. synthesis. overall, this special feature illustrates that dispersal ecology spans a broad range of research topics by integrating eight contributions that cover key aspects of this discipline: from conceptual and methodological advances to the study of the ecological and evolutionary outcomes. \u00a9 2016 the authors. journal of ecology \u00a9 2016 british ecological society",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",
