                "abstracttext": "fluctuating asymmetry (fa), i.e. small, non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in morphological characters, increases under genetic and/or environmental stress. ecological and evolutionary studies addressing fa became popular in past decades; however, their outcomes remain controversial. the discrepancies might be at least partly explained by inconsistent and non-standardised methodology. our aim was to improve the methodology of these studies by identifying factors that affect the reproducibility of fa measurements in plant leaves. six observers used a highly standardised measurement protocol to measure fa using the width, area and weight of the same set of leaves of 10 plant species that differed in leaf size, shape of the leaf margin and other leaf traits. on average, 24% of the total variation in the data was due to measurement error. reproducibility of measurements varied with the shape of leaf margin, leaf size, the measured character and the experience of the observer. the lowest reproducibility of the width of leaf halves was found for simple leaves with serrate margins and the highest for simple leaves with entire margins and for compound pinnate leaves. the reproducibility was significantly lower for the weight of leaf halves than for either their width or area, especially for plants with small leaves. the reproducibility was also lower for measurements made by experienced observers than by na\u00efve observers. the size of press-dried leaves decreased slightly but significantly relative to fresh leaves, but the fa of press-dried leaves adequately reflected the fa of fresh leaves. in contrast, preservation in 60% ethanol did not affect leaf size, but it decreased the width-based values of fa to 89.3% of the values measured from fresh leaves. we suggest that although reproducibility of leaf fa measurements depends upon many factors, the shape of the leaf margin is the most important source of variation. we recommend, whenever possible, choosing large-leaved plants with entire leaf margins as model objects for studies involving measurements of fa using the width of leaf halves. these measurements should be conducted with high accuracy from images of fresh or press-dried leaves. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "populations of the large-flowered sandwort (arenaria grandiflora l.) in the fontainebleau forest (france) have declined rapidly during the last century. despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. the low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore fontainebleau populations. consequently, a. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the fontainebleau forest in 1999. each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. after establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. at present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil ph and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. this introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. to understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. from these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation. \u00a9 2013 maurice et al.",
