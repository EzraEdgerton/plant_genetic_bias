                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",
