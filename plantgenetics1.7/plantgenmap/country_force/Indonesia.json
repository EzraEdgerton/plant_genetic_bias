                "abstracttext": "indonesia has a diversity of indigenous (i.e. wild type) begonia species that have never been artificially hybridized. they are usually situated in tropical rain forests, from the lowlands to the uplands (2400 m asl.). there are many begonia species that have not yet been collected and conserved ex-situ. hence exploration and conservation of this diversity needs to be exensively pursued. the conservation of lowland adapted begonia has been carried out for the last ten years in the bogor botanic gardens. the research reported here developed an inventory of the begonia collection held in the green house of the bogor botanic gardens nursery. the method used was a study of the plant expedition database which contains collection lists, locality of their discovery and ecological data for the localities. plant collection registration, acclimatization, propagation and collection care were documented. bogor botanic gardens has conserved 124 collections of begonia, made up of 93 indigenous species and 31 exotic species. the reported origins for the collection are as follows: java (9 accessions), sumatra (37 accessions), kalimantan (5 accessions), sulawesi (11 accessions), maluku (15 accessions), papua (4 accessions), bali and west nusa tenggara (6 accessions ) and east nusa tenggara (6 accessions). these wild begonia have prospects for development as new ornamental plants and also as genetic material to research the creation of new begonia varieties through artifial hybridization. \u00a9 2017, society for indonesian biodiversity. all rights reserved.",

                "abstracttext": "nuphar submersa (nymphaeaceae) is a critically endangered freshwater macrophyte indigenous to central japan, with only four small extant populations represented across its entire range. we investigated the genotypic and genetic diversity as well as the genetic structure of all extant individuals of n. submersa based on analysis of 15 microsatellite loci. among 278 individual ramets, 52 multilocus genotypes were detected: 30 genotypes in nikko city (nik), 18 in nasukarasuyama city (nas), 3 in mooka city (mok), and 1 in sakura city (sak). the average number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.20 to 1.93, whereas the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.11 to 0.33 and from 0.10 to 0.24, respectively. with the exception of sak, all populations contained multiple clones, but our results indicated low levels of within-population genetic diversity. the populations nik and nas comprised few large or middle-sized genets and many small genets. the populations nik and nas were suggested to comprise large old, old fragmented, and/or young small genets resulting from seedling establishment. all four populations were differentiated, and gene flow between the populations was restricted (average level of gene flow (nm)\u00a0=\u00a00.122, g\u2019st =\u00a00.639). of the total genetic diversity, 67.20 and 9.13% were attributable to inter- and intra-population diversity, respectively. structure analysis revealed two or three well-differentiated groups of populations. cluster i comprised one population (nik) and cluster ii comprised the remaining populations at k\u00a0=\u00a02. the populations nik, nas, and the remaining populations were assigned to clusters i, ii, and iii, respectively, at k\u00a0=\u00a03. for conservation practices, we recommend that each cluster be regarded as a different management unit. we further suggest that artificial gene flow among mok and sak populations is an appropriate option, whereas nik should not be reinforced with genotypes from the remaining populations. \u00a9 2016, the botanical society of japan and springer japan.",

                "abstracttext": "despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (tk) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. the convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\u2019 rights over plant genetic resources and associated tk. dna barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\u2019 rights and tk. our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural india and nepal. traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. dna was extracted and sequenced (rbcl, trnh-psba and its2) from 160 samples. both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. our research revealed considerable variation in traits and dna sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. we utilized a tiered approach using its2 dna barcode to make 100\u00a0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. we have also recorded precious tk of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. this research demonstrates the potential of dna barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. we suggest ways in which dna barcodes could be used in the protection of plant varieties and farmers\u2019 rights in india and nepal. \u00a9 2016, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "indonesia has a diversity of indigenous (i.e. wild type) begonia species that have never been artificially hybridized. they are usually situated in tropical rain forests, from the lowlands to the uplands (2400 m asl.). there are many begonia species that have not yet been collected and conserved ex-situ. hence exploration and conservation of this diversity needs to be exensively pursued. the conservation of lowland adapted begonia has been carried out for the last ten years in the bogor botanic gardens. the research reported here developed an inventory of the begonia collection held in the green house of the bogor botanic gardens nursery. the method used was a study of the plant expedition database which contains collection lists, locality of their discovery and ecological data for the localities. plant collection registration, acclimatization, propagation and collection care were documented. bogor botanic gardens has conserved 124 collections of begonia, made up of 93 indigenous species and 31 exotic species. the reported origins for the collection are as follows: java (9 accessions), sumatra (37 accessions), kalimantan (5 accessions), sulawesi (11 accessions), maluku (15 accessions), papua (4 accessions), bali and west nusa tenggara (6 accessions ) and east nusa tenggara (6 accessions). these wild begonia have prospects for development as new ornamental plants and also as genetic material to research the creation of new begonia varieties through artifial hybridization. \u00a9 2017, society for indonesian biodiversity. all rights reserved.",

                "abstracttext": "despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (tk) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. the convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\u2019 rights over plant genetic resources and associated tk. dna barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\u2019 rights and tk. our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural india and nepal. traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. dna was extracted and sequenced (rbcl, trnh-psba and its2) from 160 samples. both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. our research revealed considerable variation in traits and dna sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. we utilized a tiered approach using its2 dna barcode to make 100\u00a0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. we have also recorded precious tk of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. this research demonstrates the potential of dna barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. we suggest ways in which dna barcodes could be used in the protection of plant varieties and farmers\u2019 rights in india and nepal. \u00a9 2016, the author(s).",
