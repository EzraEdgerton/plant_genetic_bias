                "abstracttext": "background: tea is the world's most popular non-alcoholic beverage. china and india are known to be the largest tea producing countries and recognized as the centers for the domestication of the tea plant (camellia sinensis (l.) o. kuntze). however, molecular studies on the origin, domestication and relationships of the main teas, china type, assam type and cambod type are lacking. methodology/principal findings: twenty-three nuclear microsatellite markers were used to investigate the genetic diversity, relatedness, and domestication history of cultivated tea in both china and india. based on a total of 392 samples, high levels of genetic diversity were observed for all tea types in both countries. the cultivars clustered into three distinct genetic groups (i.e. china tea, chinese assam tea and indian assam tea) based on structure, pcoa and upgma analyses with significant pairwise genetic differentiation, corresponding well with their geographical distribution. a high proportion (30%) of the studied tea samples were shown to possess genetic admixtures of different tea types suggesting a hybrid origin for these samples, including the cambod type. conclusions: we demonstrate that chinese assam tea is a distinct genetic lineage from indian assam tea, and that china tea sampled from india was likely introduced from china directly. our results further indicate that china type tea, chinese assam type tea and indian assam type tea are likely the result of three independent domestication events from three separate regions across china and india. our findings have important implications for the conservation of genetic stocks, as well as future breeding programs. \u00a9 2016 meegahakumbura et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
