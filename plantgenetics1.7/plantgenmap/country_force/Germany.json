                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the potential of constructed wetlands (cws) as a low technology for wastewater treatment is timely but there is a need to understand the route of pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp.) and indicator organisms (enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli) present in wastewater within those systems and to what extent they can compromise the further use of the plants (enabling in-house ornamental use) and water reuse (irrigation purposes). in the present study the fate of potential pathogenic bacteria within a cw, with ornamental plants, and an outlet pond established in a tourism house for wastewater treatment was assessed. the fate of pathogenic bacteria in lettuce, both plant tissues and soil, subject to irrigation with water contaminated either with l. monocytogenes or e. coli (indicator organism) was investigated. the uptake of indicator organisms by the cw ornamental plants was low and there was a decrease, from the cw wastewater inlet to the outlet, of up to 3 log for enterobacteriaceae and up to 2 log for e. coli. concerning salmonella spp. no detection was registered in the water, plant tissues or substrate within the cw. on the other hand, several l. monocytogenes isolates were retrieved from water, root and substrate samples, found to have a high susceptibility to a battery of antibiotics. the irrigation of lettuce with water containing pathogenic bacteria (l. monocytogenes) and indicator organisms (e. coli) must be considered with caution since both bacteria were detected in the soil growing media and internalization of l. monocytogenes in roots was observed. these issues are poorly investigated and to our knowledge not addressed in the sphere of cws. \u00a9 2017 elsevier b.v.",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the genus chrysodracon has six endemic species in the hawaii islands. chrysodracon hawaiiensis is endemic to hawaii island and was described as a distinct species in 1980. it was listed as an endangered species on the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources (iucn) red list in 1997. this woody plant species was, at one time, common in exposed dry forests, but it became very rare due to grazing pressure and human development. the tree species chrysodracon auwahiensis (c. auwahiensis), endemic to maui and molokai, still has large adult populations in dry lands of the islands, but unfortunately no regeneration from seed has been reported in those areas for many years. the two endemic species were examined using the molecular technique of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and inter simple sequence repeats (issr) to determine the genetic structure of the populations and the amount of variation. both species possess similar genetic structure. larger and smaller populations of both species contain similar levels of genetic diversity as determined by the number of polymorphic loci, estimated heterozygosity, and shannon\u2019s index of genetic diversity. although population diversity of chrysodracon hawaiiensis (c. hawaiiensis) is thought to have remained near pre-disturbance levels, population size continues to decline as recruitment is either absent or does not keep pace with senescence of mature plants. conservation recommendations for both species are suggested. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "mango fruits are highly nutritious and economically important to kenyan farmers, who cultivate three categories of cultivars/landraces; local small-fruited, local big-fruited and improved, introduced cultivars. the small-fruited landraces are said to be well adapted to the local environment but are being replaced by introduced cultivars before their diversity has been documented. this study aimed at assessing morphological and genetic diversity of 36 local mango landraces from 35 randomly selected farms in eastern kenya. fruits were collected from three locations for morphological characterization using the \u2018descriptors for mango\u2019 of the international plant genetic resources institute. leaves of the same accessions were sampled for genetic diversity assessment using microsatellites. morphological characterization showed that mean fruit length was 5.6\u201312.5\u00a0cm, while mean fruit weight was 93\u2013578\u00a0g. fruit shape was mostly \u2018roundish\u2019, while fruit ground colour \u2018green\u2019. hierarchical cluster analysis with seven discriminant morphological variables resulted in four clusters. analysis of molecular variance (amova) indicated that variation was high (97%) among, but low (3%) within groups. phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining method resulted in three clusters that lacked consistency with the morphological clusters. findings from this study may assist to select superior local mango accessions for future breeding programmes and to develop \u2018conservation through use\u2019 strategies for kenyan local mangoes to retain their valuable genetic resources. \u00a9 2016 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group.",
