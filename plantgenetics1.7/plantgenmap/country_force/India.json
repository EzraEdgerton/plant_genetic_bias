                "abstracttext": "oceanic archipelagos are typically rich in endemic taxa, because they offer ideal conditions for diversification and speciation in isolation. one of the most remarkable evolutionary radiations on the canary islands comprises the 16 species included in limonium subsection nobiles, all of which are subject to diverse threats, and legally protected. since many of them are single-island endemics limited to one or a few populations, there exists a risk that a loss of genetic variation might limit their long-term survival. in this study, we used eight newly developed microsatellite markers to characterize the levels of genetic variation and inbreeding in l. macrophyllum, a species endemic to the north-east of tenerife that belongs to limonium subsection nobiles. we detected generally low levels of genetic variation over all populations (ht = 0.363), and substantial differentiation among populations (fst = 0.188; rst = 0.186) coupled with a negligible degree of inbreeding (f = 0.042). obligate outcrossing may have maintained l. macrophyllum relatively unaffected by inbreeding despite the species\u2019 limited dispersal ability and the genetic bottlenecks likely caused by a prolonged history of grazing. although several factors still constitute a risk for the conservation of l. macrophyllum, the lack of inbreeding and the recent positive demographic trends observed in the populations of this species are factors that favour its future persistence. \u00a9 2017, springer international publishing switzerland.",

                "abstracttext": "despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (tk) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. the convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\u2019 rights over plant genetic resources and associated tk. dna barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\u2019 rights and tk. our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural india and nepal. traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. dna was extracted and sequenced (rbcl, trnh-psba and its2) from 160 samples. both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. our research revealed considerable variation in traits and dna sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. we utilized a tiered approach using its2 dna barcode to make 100\u00a0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. we have also recorded precious tk of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. this research demonstrates the potential of dna barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. we suggest ways in which dna barcodes could be used in the protection of plant varieties and farmers\u2019 rights in india and nepal. \u00a9 2016, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "over the past decade, a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry, centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade. accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous san and khoi have also launched demands\u2014to date unmet\u2014for a stake in rooibos benefits. meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. all remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the south african apartheid system. the melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as \u201cthe mother\u201d and \u201ctesting ground\u201d of so-called access and benefit sharing. such approaches stem in part from the convention on biological diversity and its nagoya protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. with growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach. \u00a9 2016 saab",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "we used rapd markers to study the population genetic structure and diversity of saxifraga rosacea subsp. sponhemica, a rare central european endemic rock plant with a highly disjunct distribution. because of strong isolation current gene flow between populations is very low or absent. however, an isolation by distance pattern of genetic differentiation suggested historical gene flow during the last glaciation when suitable habitats for s. sponhemica were much more abundant. in most populations, considerable genetic variability has been preserved due to the longevity of s. sponhemica. our results suggest that long-lived plant species can maintain historic genetic patterns despite small size and strong isolation of populations. several rapd loci were identified to be non-neutral and their frequencies correlated with climatic gradients, indicating natural selection. adaptive genetic variation could be important for adaptation to environmental changes like ongoing climate change. the taxon does not appear to be genetically threatened in the short term, but populations are threatened by habitat destruction. the establishment of new populations in suitable habitats with seeds from the same region may be a suitable conservation measure avoiding potential maladaptation due to local adaptation. \u00a9 2014, the author(s).",
