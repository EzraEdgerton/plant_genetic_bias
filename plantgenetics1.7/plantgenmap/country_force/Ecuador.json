                "abstracttext": "there is currently a great interest in studying functional traits in plants that aid to predict ecological interactions and responses of species to environmental or anthropological changes in ecosystems. seeds'morphological traits play a relevant role along the whole life cycle of plants. however, they have not been well studied from functional perspective in different habitats especially in tropical dry areas, where there is great diversity of species at high risk of threat. the tumbesian dry forests occurring in the southwestern of ecuador and northwestern of peru, are considered as hotspots owing to their high biodiversity and endemism. however, this ecosystem is highly threatened and some tree and shrub species have already been included in red for this reason, it is urgent to generate information that may promote the conservation of forest genetic resources of tropical dry forests. one of the most practical and immediate alternative is the collection and ex situ storage of seeds. however, in tropical dry habitats, the morphological, physiological and ecological traits of seeds are largely unknown which may prevent the performance of ex situ conservation strategies. this knowledge is important in order to efficiently collect and storage seeds that can be used in active restoration plants. in this article we provide information about morphological seeds traits of tumbesian woody species and how such traits influence the process of seed collection and storage. \u00a9 2016 los autores.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "this study aimed to assess the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (sgs) and gene flow among the developmental stages of acrocomia aculeata (arecaceae) in a natural population of the brazilian savannah. the study was conducted in a 4.5\u00a0ha area using a population census composed of 72 adult and 144 juvenile plants. six-hundred embryo samples were analyzed to investigate the gene flow of plant progenies. all individuals were genotyped using seven microsatellite loci. the microsatellite loci generated 10.1 alleles on average. observed heterozygosity (ho) was lower than expected heterozygosity (he) in all stages of development. the mean ho and he values were 0.496 and 0.688, respectively. the a. aculeata population presented high genetic diversity despite its significant positive fixation index (0.279, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). significant sgs was observed for adults at the 2-m distance class and for juveniles at the 2 and 4-m distance classes. average pollen flow distance was 105\u00a0m. high multilocus outcrossing rate was observed (1.2), indicating that the species is preferentially allogamous with evidence of self-incompatibility mechanisms. the a. aculeata population presents high potential for in situ and ex situ genetic conservation and germplasm collection. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",
