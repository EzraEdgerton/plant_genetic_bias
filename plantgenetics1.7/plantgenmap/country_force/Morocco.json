                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the potential of constructed wetlands (cws) as a low technology for wastewater treatment is timely but there is a need to understand the route of pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp.) and indicator organisms (enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli) present in wastewater within those systems and to what extent they can compromise the further use of the plants (enabling in-house ornamental use) and water reuse (irrigation purposes). in the present study the fate of potential pathogenic bacteria within a cw, with ornamental plants, and an outlet pond established in a tourism house for wastewater treatment was assessed. the fate of pathogenic bacteria in lettuce, both plant tissues and soil, subject to irrigation with water contaminated either with l. monocytogenes or e. coli (indicator organism) was investigated. the uptake of indicator organisms by the cw ornamental plants was low and there was a decrease, from the cw wastewater inlet to the outlet, of up to 3 log for enterobacteriaceae and up to 2 log for e. coli. concerning salmonella spp. no detection was registered in the water, plant tissues or substrate within the cw. on the other hand, several l. monocytogenes isolates were retrieved from water, root and substrate samples, found to have a high susceptibility to a battery of antibiotics. the irrigation of lettuce with water containing pathogenic bacteria (l. monocytogenes) and indicator organisms (e. coli) must be considered with caution since both bacteria were detected in the soil growing media and internalization of l. monocytogenes in roots was observed. these issues are poorly investigated and to our knowledge not addressed in the sphere of cws. \u00a9 2017 elsevier b.v.",
