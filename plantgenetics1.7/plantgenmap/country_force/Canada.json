                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",
