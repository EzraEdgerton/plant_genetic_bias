                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
