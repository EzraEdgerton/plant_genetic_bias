                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "whitebark pine (wbp, pinus albicaulis engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (wpbr, caused by cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae). information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. however, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for wbp. in this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from wbp breeding programs in western north america. rna-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the wbp needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous snps (ns-snps). following the annotation of genes with ns-snps, 216 ns-snps within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design snp arrays for high-throughput genotyping. among these snp loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from british columbia (canada), oregon and washington (usa). a clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the wbp breeding populations. genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of wpbr disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of wbp genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to wpbr. the wbp genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines. \u00a9 this is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. the work is made available under the creative commons cc0 public domain dedication.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the fungus neonectria neomacrospora has recently caused an epidemic outbreak in conifer species within the genus abies in denmark and norway. christmas tree producers in europe and north america rely, to a large extent, on abies species. the damage caused by n.\u00a0neomacrospora, including dead shoot tips, red flagging of branches and potentially dead trees, have therefore caused concern about reduced quality and loss of trees, and thereby of revenue. field observations of natural infection of 39 taxa, from 32 species, within the genus abies in the h\u00f8rsholm arboretum, denmark, were evaluated; significant differences were seen between taxa, that is, species, and between some species and their subspecies. the greek fir, abies cephalonica, was the only species without damage. an inoculation experiment on detached twigs with mycelium plugs from a n.\u00a0neomacrospora culture showed that all species could be infected. the damage observed in the inoculation experiment could explain 30% of the variation in the field observations based on species mean values. the epidemic outbreak and the high number of species susceptible to this fungus indicate that n.\u00a0neomacrospora requires attention in the cultivation and conservation of abies species. \u00a9 2017 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "here we present the results of a multiple organizational level analysis conceived to identify acclimative/adaptive strategies exhibited by the seagrass posidonia oceanica to the daily fluctuations in the light environment, at contrasting depths. we assessed changes in photophysiological parameters, leaf respiration, pigments, and protein and mrna expression levels. the results show that the diel oscillations of p. oceanica photophysiological and respiratory responses were related to transcripts and proteins expression of the genes involved in those processes and that there was a response asynchrony between shallow and deep plants probably caused by the strong differences in the light environment. the photochemical pathway of energy use was more effective in shallow plants due to higher light availability, but these plants needed more investment in photoprotection and photorepair, requiring higher translation and protein synthesis than deep plants. the genetic differentiation between deep and shallow stands suggests the existence of locally adapted genotypes to contrasting light environments. the depth-specific diel rhythms of photosynthetic and respiratory processes, from molecular to physiological levels, must be considered in the management and conservation of these key coastal ecosystems. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "over the past decade, a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry, centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade. accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous san and khoi have also launched demands\u2014to date unmet\u2014for a stake in rooibos benefits. meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. all remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the south african apartheid system. the melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as \u201cthe mother\u201d and \u201ctesting ground\u201d of so-called access and benefit sharing. such approaches stem in part from the convention on biological diversity and its nagoya protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. with growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach. \u00a9 2016 saab",

                "abstracttext": "here we present the results of a multiple organizational level analysis conceived to identify acclimative/adaptive strategies exhibited by the seagrass posidonia oceanica to the daily fluctuations in the light environment, at contrasting depths. we assessed changes in photophysiological parameters, leaf respiration, pigments, and protein and mrna expression levels. the results show that the diel oscillations of p. oceanica photophysiological and respiratory responses were related to transcripts and proteins expression of the genes involved in those processes and that there was a response asynchrony between shallow and deep plants probably caused by the strong differences in the light environment. the photochemical pathway of energy use was more effective in shallow plants due to higher light availability, but these plants needed more investment in photoprotection and photorepair, requiring higher translation and protein synthesis than deep plants. the genetic differentiation between deep and shallow stands suggests the existence of locally adapted genotypes to contrasting light environments. the depth-specific diel rhythms of photosynthetic and respiratory processes, from molecular to physiological levels, must be considered in the management and conservation of these key coastal ecosystems. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",

                "abstracttext": "we report on how a long-term study of the reproductive biology of the critically endangered schiedea adamantis (caryophyllaceae), one of hawai\u2018i's rarest plant species, was leveraged for conservation purposes. our major goals were to provide seeds with the greatest genetic variation possible for reintroduction and to ensure that both female and hermaphroditic plants of this wind-pollinated species were reintroduced in a manner that maximized both outcrossing and seed production. schiedea adamantis was one of the first hawaiian plant species listed under the endangered species act (usa). the species has been studied intensively to test hypotheses addressing the evolution of breeding systems. information on outcrossing levels and the extent of inbreeding depression was integrated into ongoing reintroduction efforts. population size peaked in 1994, when 267 flowering individuals were found on l\u0113\u2018ahi (diamond head crater). by 2016 only 17 flowering individuals were present, with drought and invasive species being possible causes of this decline. reintroduction attempts in 1998 using genetically diverse seeds were unsuccessful because of drought and a lack of sufficient supplemental irrigation. additional reintroduction attempts in 2012 and 2014 were more successful because of increased supplemental irrigation. plants used in reintroductions represent genotypes long since absent in the natural population, and may contain the genetic variability essential for evolutionary responses to climate change and the spread of invasive species. the destruction of many plants reintroduced in 2015 and 2016 by a fire in march 2016 highlights the need for additional restoration areas at l\u0113\u2018ahi and elsewhere, and storage of seeds for future use. copyright \u00a9 fauna & flora international 2017",
