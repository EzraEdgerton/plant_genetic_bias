                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "whitebark pine (wbp, pinus albicaulis engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (wpbr, caused by cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae). information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. however, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for wbp. in this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from wbp breeding programs in western north america. rna-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the wbp needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous snps (ns-snps). following the annotation of genes with ns-snps, 216 ns-snps within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design snp arrays for high-throughput genotyping. among these snp loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from british columbia (canada), oregon and washington (usa). a clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the wbp breeding populations. genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of wpbr disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of wbp genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to wpbr. the wbp genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines. \u00a9 this is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. the work is made available under the creative commons cc0 public domain dedication.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",
