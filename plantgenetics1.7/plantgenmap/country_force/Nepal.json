                "abstracttext": "despite the extensive use of small millet landraces as an important source of nutrition for people living in semi-arid regions, they are presently marginalized and their diversity and distribution are threatened at a global scale. local farmers have developed ancient breeding programs entrenched in traditional knowledge (tk) that has sustained rural cultures for thousands of years. the convention on biological diversity seeks fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources arising from local knowledge and requires signatory nations to provide appropriate policy and legal framework to farmers\u2019 rights over plant genetic resources and associated tk. dna barcoding employed in this study is proposed as a model for conservation of genetic diversity and an essential step towards documenting and protecting farmers\u2019 rights and tk. our study focuses on 32 landraces of small millets that are still used by indigenous farmers located in the rain fed areas of rural india and nepal. traditional knowledge of traits and utility was gathered using participatory methods and semi-structured interviews with key informants. dna was extracted and sequenced (rbcl, trnh-psba and its2) from 160 samples. both multivariate analysis of traits and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess diversity among small millet landraces. our research revealed considerable variation in traits and dna sequences among the 32 small millet landraces. we utilized a tiered approach using its2 dna barcode to make 100\u00a0% accurate landrace (32 landraces) and species (six species) assignments for all 160 blind samples in our study. we have also recorded precious tk of nutritional value, ecological and agricultural traits used by local farmers for each of these traditional landraces. this research demonstrates the potential of dna barcoding as a reliable identification tool and for use in evaluating and conserving genetic diversity of small millets. we suggest ways in which dna barcodes could be used in the protection of plant varieties and farmers\u2019 rights in india and nepal. \u00a9 2016, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "indonesia has a diversity of indigenous (i.e. wild type) begonia species that have never been artificially hybridized. they are usually situated in tropical rain forests, from the lowlands to the uplands (2400 m asl.). there are many begonia species that have not yet been collected and conserved ex-situ. hence exploration and conservation of this diversity needs to be exensively pursued. the conservation of lowland adapted begonia has been carried out for the last ten years in the bogor botanic gardens. the research reported here developed an inventory of the begonia collection held in the green house of the bogor botanic gardens nursery. the method used was a study of the plant expedition database which contains collection lists, locality of their discovery and ecological data for the localities. plant collection registration, acclimatization, propagation and collection care were documented. bogor botanic gardens has conserved 124 collections of begonia, made up of 93 indigenous species and 31 exotic species. the reported origins for the collection are as follows: java (9 accessions), sumatra (37 accessions), kalimantan (5 accessions), sulawesi (11 accessions), maluku (15 accessions), papua (4 accessions), bali and west nusa tenggara (6 accessions ) and east nusa tenggara (6 accessions). these wild begonia have prospects for development as new ornamental plants and also as genetic material to research the creation of new begonia varieties through artifial hybridization. \u00a9 2017, society for indonesian biodiversity. all rights reserved.",
