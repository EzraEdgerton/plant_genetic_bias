                "abstracttext": "mango fruits are highly nutritious and economically important to kenyan farmers, who cultivate three categories of cultivars/landraces; local small-fruited, local big-fruited and improved, introduced cultivars. the small-fruited landraces are said to be well adapted to the local environment but are being replaced by introduced cultivars before their diversity has been documented. this study aimed at assessing morphological and genetic diversity of 36 local mango landraces from 35 randomly selected farms in eastern kenya. fruits were collected from three locations for morphological characterization using the \u2018descriptors for mango\u2019 of the international plant genetic resources institute. leaves of the same accessions were sampled for genetic diversity assessment using microsatellites. morphological characterization showed that mean fruit length was 5.6\u201312.5\u00a0cm, while mean fruit weight was 93\u2013578\u00a0g. fruit shape was mostly \u2018roundish\u2019, while fruit ground colour \u2018green\u2019. hierarchical cluster analysis with seven discriminant morphological variables resulted in four clusters. analysis of molecular variance (amova) indicated that variation was high (97%) among, but low (3%) within groups. phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining method resulted in three clusters that lacked consistency with the morphological clusters. findings from this study may assist to select superior local mango accessions for future breeding programmes and to develop \u2018conservation through use\u2019 strategies for kenyan local mangoes to retain their valuable genetic resources. \u00a9 2016 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group.",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
