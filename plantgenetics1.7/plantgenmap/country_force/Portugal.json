                "abstracttext": "dispersal ecology is a broad topical discipline that tackles important conceptual and applied issues, such as the study of the ability of plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes. the relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because: (i) dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse (or produce propagules to be dispersed) to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns; (ii) by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry, dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape; and (iii) dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity, such as species assembly in species-rich communities. the steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address conservation issues have expanded the disciplinary boundaries of dispersal ecology. the discussion on the main advances on and challenges for dispersal ecology was the main motivation for the organization of a thematic topic session entitled dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world at the annual meeting of the british ecological society (2015, edinburgh). this session brought together researchers with different types of expertise and interests on dispersal processes and their contributions are now included in this special feature together with a few additional articles. synthesis. overall, this special feature illustrates that dispersal ecology spans a broad range of research topics by integrating eight contributions that cover key aspects of this discipline: from conceptual and methodological advances to the study of the ecological and evolutionary outcomes. \u00a9 2016 the authors. journal of ecology \u00a9 2016 british ecological society",

                "abstracttext": "dispersal ecology is a broad topical discipline that tackles important conceptual and applied issues, such as the study of the ability of plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes. the relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because: (i) dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse (or produce propagules to be dispersed) to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns; (ii) by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry, dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape; and (iii) dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity, such as species assembly in species-rich communities. the steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address conservation issues have expanded the disciplinary boundaries of dispersal ecology. the discussion on the main advances on and challenges for dispersal ecology was the main motivation for the organization of a thematic topic session entitled dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world at the annual meeting of the british ecological society (2015, edinburgh). this session brought together researchers with different types of expertise and interests on dispersal processes and their contributions are now included in this special feature together with a few additional articles. synthesis. overall, this special feature illustrates that dispersal ecology spans a broad range of research topics by integrating eight contributions that cover key aspects of this discipline: from conceptual and methodological advances to the study of the ecological and evolutionary outcomes. \u00a9 2016 the authors. journal of ecology \u00a9 2016 british ecological society",

                "abstracttext": "a collection of 102 diaporthe isolates was compiled from lesions on carrot, parsley and wild apiaceae species in france from 2010 to 2014. molecular typing based on its rdna sequences resulted in the identification of 85 d.\u00a0angelicae and 17 d.\u00a0eres isolates. based on sequences of the 3\u2032 part of the igs rdna, intraspecific variability was analysed for 17 d.\u00a0angelicae and 13 d.\u00a0eres isolates from diverse plant species, locations in france, and plant tissues. the genetic diversity was greater for d.\u00a0angelicae isolates than d.\u00a0eres isolates. in vitro sensitivity of five d.\u00a0angelicae and four d.\u00a0eres isolates to each of nine fungicides was similar for isolates of both species, with a marked variation in fungicide sensitivity depending on the active ingredient. to assess the pathogenicity of d.\u00a0angelicae and d.\u00a0eres isolates on carrot, one isolate of each species was inoculated onto umbels in a controlled environment. typical lesions were observed for both isolates. carrot crop debris collected from a seed production field in france and placed in controlled conditions produced perithecia and ascospores typical of diaporthe, that were further characterized molecularly as belonging to d.\u00a0angelicae. detection of diaporthe species on seed lots from three carrot production fields in france was investigated. both species were detected on seeds by conventional pcr assay, with a greater frequency for d.\u00a0angelicae than d.\u00a0eres (67% vs 33%, respectively). overall, the results highlighted that umbel browning in carrot seed crops in france was mainly caused by d.\u00a0angelicae. \u00a9 2016 british society for plant pathology",

                "abstracttext": "the colonization of land by plants shaped the terrestrial biosphere, the geosphere and global climates. the nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. in the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. in the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophyteswere an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. the data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. \u00a9 2016 the author(s).",
