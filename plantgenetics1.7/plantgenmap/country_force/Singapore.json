                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "vavilovia formosa is one of five genera in tribe fabeae, (fabaceae, leguminosae) with close phylogenetic relationships to pisum. it grows in subalpine and alpine levels in armenia, azerbaijan, georgia, iran, iraq, lebanon, russia and turkey and is recognized as an endangered and protected plant. this study was conducted to reveal its intraspecific variability, as well as to predict the past, extant and future species distribution range. we analysed 51 accessions with common phylogenetic markers (trnf-trnl, trns-trng, matk, rbcl, psba-trnh and its). these represent in total up to 2551\u00a0bp of chloroplast and 664\u00a0bp of nuclear sequences per sample. two populations from turkey and armenia were analysed for genetic diversity by aflp. leaf morphometry was conducted on 1457 leaflets from 43 specimens. extracted bioclimatic parameters were used for niche-modelling approach. analysis of cpdna revealed two haplotypes, 12 samples from armenia, daghestan, nakhichevan and iran belonged to h1 group, while 39 samples of all turkish and part of armenian were in h2 group. the mean intrapopulation diversity based on aflp was low (he\u00a0=\u00a00.088) indicating limited outcrossing rate. a significantly positive correlation between geographical latitude and leaf area (\u03c1 =\u00a00.527, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) was found. niche modelling has shown temporal variation of predicted occurrence across the projected time periods. vavilovia formosa has suffered a range reduction following climate warming after last glacial maximum, which classify this species as cold-adapted among the fabeae species as well as a glacial relict. \u00a9 2017, springer-verlag wien.",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
