                "abstracttext": "seed longevity, the maintenance of viability during storage, is a major factor for conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity. seed longevity is an important trait of agriculture crop and is impaired by reactive oxygen species (ros) during seed desiccation, storage and germination (c. r. biol., 331, 2008 and 796). seeds possess a wide range of systems (protection, detoxification, repair) allowing them to survive during storage and to preserve a high germination ability. in many plants, 1-cys peroxiredoxin (1-cys prx, also named per1) is a seed-specific antioxidant which eliminates ros with cysteine residues. here we identified and characterized a seed-specific per1 protein from seeds of sacred lotus (nelumbo nucifera gaertn.). purified nnper1 protein protects dna against the cleavage by ros in the mixed-function oxidation system. the transcription and protein accumulation of nnper1 increased during seed desiccation and imbibition and under abiotic stress treatment. ectopic expression of nnper1 in arabidopsis enhanced the seed germination ability after controlled deterioration treatment (cdt), indicating that nnper1 improves seed longevity of transgenic plants. consistent with the function of nnper1 on detoxifying ros, we found that the level of ros release and lipid peroxidation was strikingly lower in transgenic seeds compared to wild-type with or without cdt. furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis seeds ectopic-expressing nnper1 displayed enhanced tolerance to high temperature and abscisic acid (aba), indicating that nnper1 may participate in the thermotolerance and aba signaling pathway. \u00a9 2016 the authors the plant journal \u00a9 2016 john wiley & sons ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the agriculture sector is embracing energy efficient conservation systems and technological innovations to meet the ever increasing demand for food, fibre, and fuel in tune with the rapidly increasing human population. the genetic modification of plants is one of the technological innovations that is adopted rapidly across the world. in cotton, many major producing countries have adopted herbicide-tolerant genetically modified crops. over-reliance on herbicides for weed management in both genetically modified and conventional systems has led to the rapid evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. poor weed management can cause up to 90% yield loss in cotton. undoubtedly, integration of non-chemical methods and diversifying weed control options would ensure the sustainability of available weed management options, including herbicides. increasing crop competitiveness is one of the approaches that could be integrated with the current weed management systems. choosing cultivars with early vigour, use of narrow row planting, orienting crop rows with regard to sunlight, and adjusting planting density are some of the approaches that could enhance the competitiveness of crops over weeds. review of the available literature on cotton indicates weed suppressive benefits by enhancing crop competitiveness through increasing planting density and narrow row spacing. early canopy closure in narrow row spaced systems would suppress many problem weeds. in addition, herbicide efficacy may be increased due to competition offered by a dense crop stand, which may reduce herbicide selection pressure on weeds. however, the use of narrow row spacing is still in an infant stage in many cotton-growing countries and the success may depend on the environment, soil type, and resource availability. this review analyses and reports the potential benefits of increasing crop competition as a weed management option and also highlights research to be undertaken to ensure the adoption of different strategies on a much wider scale. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "seed longevity, the maintenance of viability during storage, is a major factor for conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity. seed longevity is an important trait of agriculture crop and is impaired by reactive oxygen species (ros) during seed desiccation, storage and germination (c. r. biol., 331, 2008 and 796). seeds possess a wide range of systems (protection, detoxification, repair) allowing them to survive during storage and to preserve a high germination ability. in many plants, 1-cys peroxiredoxin (1-cys prx, also named per1) is a seed-specific antioxidant which eliminates ros with cysteine residues. here we identified and characterized a seed-specific per1 protein from seeds of sacred lotus (nelumbo nucifera gaertn.). purified nnper1 protein protects dna against the cleavage by ros in the mixed-function oxidation system. the transcription and protein accumulation of nnper1 increased during seed desiccation and imbibition and under abiotic stress treatment. ectopic expression of nnper1 in arabidopsis enhanced the seed germination ability after controlled deterioration treatment (cdt), indicating that nnper1 improves seed longevity of transgenic plants. consistent with the function of nnper1 on detoxifying ros, we found that the level of ros release and lipid peroxidation was strikingly lower in transgenic seeds compared to wild-type with or without cdt. furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis seeds ectopic-expressing nnper1 displayed enhanced tolerance to high temperature and abscisic acid (aba), indicating that nnper1 may participate in the thermotolerance and aba signaling pathway. \u00a9 2016 the authors the plant journal \u00a9 2016 john wiley & sons ltd",
