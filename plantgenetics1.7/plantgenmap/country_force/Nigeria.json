                "abstracttext": "crassocephalum crepidioides (benth) s. moore is an important african traditional leaf vegetable, but its production is very low and its existence threatened. an efficient and reproducible micropropagation protocol of c. crepidioides was developed from nodal stem segments of pot-grown plants. shoot induction was obtained on murashige and skoog (ms) medium supplemented with benzineamino purine (bap) alone and in combination with zeatin and naphthalene acetic acid (naa). elongated shoots successfully rooted on zeatin alone and in combination with indole butyric acid (iba). molecular stability of micropropagated plants was evaluated using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) markers. survival of nodal segments in micropropagation medium was greater than 70% in all treatments. the presence of plant growth regulators (pgrs) in ms medium influenced shoot formation, rooting, and number of shoots and roots per explant. the best shoot formation frequency (88.7%), number of shoots per explant (3.7), and shoot length (30 mm) were from a medium containing ms supplemented with 10 mg\u00b7l\u22121 bap, 15 mg\u00b7l\u22121 naa, and 1.5 mg\u00b7l\u22121 zeatin. frequency of root formation and survival of regenerated plants were greater on medium containing half-strength ms salt than medium fortified with full-strength ms salt. the best frequency of root formation (average 87.4%) and survival of regenerated plants (average 95.4%) were from media containing 6.0 mg\u00b7l\u22121 zeatin and 1.0\u20131.5 mg\u00b7l\u22121 iba and half-strength ms salt. micropropagated shoots with well-developed roots were acclimatized under greenhouse conditions in pots containing rich sandy loam soil (ph = 7.2). the rapd amplification products were monomorphic in micropropagated plants and similar to those of the mother plant. no polymorphism was detected, indicating genetic uniformity of micropropagated plants. this is the first report of micropropagation of c. crepidioides, which will facilitate in vitro mass propagation, conservation, and germplasm exchange of this endangered african vegetable. \u00a9 2017 taylor & francis group, llc.",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",
