                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "nuphar submersa (nymphaeaceae) is a critically endangered freshwater macrophyte indigenous to central japan, with only four small extant populations represented across its entire range. we investigated the genotypic and genetic diversity as well as the genetic structure of all extant individuals of n. submersa based on analysis of 15 microsatellite loci. among 278 individual ramets, 52 multilocus genotypes were detected: 30 genotypes in nikko city (nik), 18 in nasukarasuyama city (nas), 3 in mooka city (mok), and 1 in sakura city (sak). the average number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.20 to 1.93, whereas the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.11 to 0.33 and from 0.10 to 0.24, respectively. with the exception of sak, all populations contained multiple clones, but our results indicated low levels of within-population genetic diversity. the populations nik and nas comprised few large or middle-sized genets and many small genets. the populations nik and nas were suggested to comprise large old, old fragmented, and/or young small genets resulting from seedling establishment. all four populations were differentiated, and gene flow between the populations was restricted (average level of gene flow (nm)\u00a0=\u00a00.122, g\u2019st =\u00a00.639). of the total genetic diversity, 67.20 and 9.13% were attributable to inter- and intra-population diversity, respectively. structure analysis revealed two or three well-differentiated groups of populations. cluster i comprised one population (nik) and cluster ii comprised the remaining populations at k\u00a0=\u00a02. the populations nik, nas, and the remaining populations were assigned to clusters i, ii, and iii, respectively, at k\u00a0=\u00a03. for conservation practices, we recommend that each cluster be regarded as a different management unit. we further suggest that artificial gene flow among mok and sak populations is an appropriate option, whereas nik should not be reinforced with genotypes from the remaining populations. \u00a9 2016, the botanical society of japan and springer japan.",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
