                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "here we present the results of a multiple organizational level analysis conceived to identify acclimative/adaptive strategies exhibited by the seagrass posidonia oceanica to the daily fluctuations in the light environment, at contrasting depths. we assessed changes in photophysiological parameters, leaf respiration, pigments, and protein and mrna expression levels. the results show that the diel oscillations of p. oceanica photophysiological and respiratory responses were related to transcripts and proteins expression of the genes involved in those processes and that there was a response asynchrony between shallow and deep plants probably caused by the strong differences in the light environment. the photochemical pathway of energy use was more effective in shallow plants due to higher light availability, but these plants needed more investment in photoprotection and photorepair, requiring higher translation and protein synthesis than deep plants. the genetic differentiation between deep and shallow stands suggests the existence of locally adapted genotypes to contrasting light environments. the depth-specific diel rhythms of photosynthetic and respiratory processes, from molecular to physiological levels, must be considered in the management and conservation of these key coastal ecosystems. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "the last resort for conservation of rare tree populations in refugial areas under high risk of climate driven extinction may be ex situ conservation and assisted translocation. although such actions require detailed knowledge about the spatial scale and heterogeneity of the within-population distribution of genetic diversity, it is still unknown whether fine-scale spatial genetic structure (fsgs) is present in refugial populations of forest trees. in order to address this issue, we carried out the first whole-population genetic characterisation of a small and isolated refugial population of the iucn red-listed serbian spruce [picea omorika (pan\u010d.) purk.] from the balkans. all 418 adult individuals were georeferenced and genotyped at nuclear est-ssrs and at a mitochondrial (mtdna) locus. spatial autocorrelation analyses provided only a simplified description of fsgs, which is concordant with findings in wind-pollinated species with limited seed dispersal. however, bayesian analysis revealed three heterogeneous, highly differentiated (pairwise g\u2019st &gt; 0.3), and spatially localised sub-populations showing only partial overlap with the distribution of mtdna haplotypes. such complex structure in only 0.34 ha, resulting mainly from historical events, restrictions to gene flow and high local density, was undetected in previous work based on more traditional sampling schemes for population genetics surveys. we demonstrate the usefulness of sampling schemes leaning towards a whole-population genetic characterisation in mining the finest characteristics of fsgs, and argue that our understanding of genetic structuring in highly heterogeneous refugial regions at both macro- and micro-scales is still rather limited and often oversimplified. this has severe implications on conservation of plant biodiversity from these regions in terms of responses to global climate change. \u00a9 2017 springer science+business media dordrecht",
