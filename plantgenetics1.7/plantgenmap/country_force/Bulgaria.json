                "abstracttext": "transposable elements usually comprise the most abundant nongenic fraction of eukaryotic genomes. because of their capacity to selfreplicate and to induce a wide range of mutations, transposable elements have long been considered as \u2018parasitic\u2019 or \u2018selfish\u2019. today, we recognize that the findings about genomic changes affected by transposable elements have considerably altered our view of the ways in which genomes evolve and work. numerous studies have provided evidences that mobile elements have the potential to act as agents of evolution by increasing, rearranging and diversifying the genetic repertoire of their hosts. with large-scale sequencing becoming increasingly available, more and more scientists come across transposable element sequences in their data. i will provide examples that transposable elements, although having signatures of \u2018selfish\u2019 dna, play a significant biological role in the maintainance of genome integrity and providing novel regulatoty networks. these features, along with the transpositional and mutagenic capacity to produce a raw genetic diversity, make the genome mobile fraction, a key player in species adaptation and microevolution. the last but not least, transposable elements stand as informative dna markers that may complement other conventional dna markers. altogether, transposable elements represent a promising, but still largely unexplored research niche and deserve to be included into the agenda of molecular ecologists, evolutionary geneticists, conservation biologists and plant breeders. \u00a9 2016, indian academy of sciences.",

                "abstracttext": "vavilovia formosa is one of five genera in tribe fabeae, (fabaceae, leguminosae) with close phylogenetic relationships to pisum. it grows in subalpine and alpine levels in armenia, azerbaijan, georgia, iran, iraq, lebanon, russia and turkey and is recognized as an endangered and protected plant. this study was conducted to reveal its intraspecific variability, as well as to predict the past, extant and future species distribution range. we analysed 51 accessions with common phylogenetic markers (trnf-trnl, trns-trng, matk, rbcl, psba-trnh and its). these represent in total up to 2551\u00a0bp of chloroplast and 664\u00a0bp of nuclear sequences per sample. two populations from turkey and armenia were analysed for genetic diversity by aflp. leaf morphometry was conducted on 1457 leaflets from 43 specimens. extracted bioclimatic parameters were used for niche-modelling approach. analysis of cpdna revealed two haplotypes, 12 samples from armenia, daghestan, nakhichevan and iran belonged to h1 group, while 39 samples of all turkish and part of armenian were in h2 group. the mean intrapopulation diversity based on aflp was low (he\u00a0=\u00a00.088) indicating limited outcrossing rate. a significantly positive correlation between geographical latitude and leaf area (\u03c1 =\u00a00.527, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) was found. niche modelling has shown temporal variation of predicted occurrence across the projected time periods. vavilovia formosa has suffered a range reduction following climate warming after last glacial maximum, which classify this species as cold-adapted among the fabeae species as well as a glacial relict. \u00a9 2017, springer-verlag wien.",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",
