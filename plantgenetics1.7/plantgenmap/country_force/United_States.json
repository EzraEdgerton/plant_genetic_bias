                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "korea is considered one of the centers of genetic diversity for cultivated as well as wild soybeans. natural habitats of wild soybeans are distributed across the korean mainland and the islands surrounding the korean peninsula. in this study, the genetic diversity of 100 mainland korean wild soybean accessions was evaluated by using 42 simple sequence repeat markers covering 17 soybean chromosomes. all analyzed loci were polymorphic and a total of 114 alleles were found. the observed average genetic diversity was low (0.4). the results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. these results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern. the present study could provide useful information for the ex situ conservation and exploitation of wild soybean accessions in soybean improvement stratagems, and will aid in further understanding about the phylogeography of the species in the korean center of diversity. \u00a9 2017 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "oceanic archipelagos are typically rich in endemic taxa, because they offer ideal conditions for diversification and speciation in isolation. one of the most remarkable evolutionary radiations on the canary islands comprises the 16 species included in limonium subsection nobiles, all of which are subject to diverse threats, and legally protected. since many of them are single-island endemics limited to one or a few populations, there exists a risk that a loss of genetic variation might limit their long-term survival. in this study, we used eight newly developed microsatellite markers to characterize the levels of genetic variation and inbreeding in l. macrophyllum, a species endemic to the north-east of tenerife that belongs to limonium subsection nobiles. we detected generally low levels of genetic variation over all populations (ht = 0.363), and substantial differentiation among populations (fst = 0.188; rst = 0.186) coupled with a negligible degree of inbreeding (f = 0.042). obligate outcrossing may have maintained l. macrophyllum relatively unaffected by inbreeding despite the species\u2019 limited dispersal ability and the genetic bottlenecks likely caused by a prolonged history of grazing. although several factors still constitute a risk for the conservation of l. macrophyllum, the lack of inbreeding and the recent positive demographic trends observed in the populations of this species are factors that favour its future persistence. \u00a9 2017, springer international publishing switzerland.",

                "abstracttext": "climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. to mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (cwrs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. we investigate the potential impact of climate change on cwr richness in norway. the consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 \u00b0c temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. the results indicate a pattern of shifting cwr richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority cwrs in norway are presented. the methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security. \u00a9 2017 royal swedish academy of sciences",

                "abstracttext": "mango fruits are highly nutritious and economically important to kenyan farmers, who cultivate three categories of cultivars/landraces; local small-fruited, local big-fruited and improved, introduced cultivars. the small-fruited landraces are said to be well adapted to the local environment but are being replaced by introduced cultivars before their diversity has been documented. this study aimed at assessing morphological and genetic diversity of 36 local mango landraces from 35 randomly selected farms in eastern kenya. fruits were collected from three locations for morphological characterization using the \u2018descriptors for mango\u2019 of the international plant genetic resources institute. leaves of the same accessions were sampled for genetic diversity assessment using microsatellites. morphological characterization showed that mean fruit length was 5.6\u201312.5\u00a0cm, while mean fruit weight was 93\u2013578\u00a0g. fruit shape was mostly \u2018roundish\u2019, while fruit ground colour \u2018green\u2019. hierarchical cluster analysis with seven discriminant morphological variables resulted in four clusters. analysis of molecular variance (amova) indicated that variation was high (97%) among, but low (3%) within groups. phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining method resulted in three clusters that lacked consistency with the morphological clusters. findings from this study may assist to select superior local mango accessions for future breeding programmes and to develop \u2018conservation through use\u2019 strategies for kenyan local mangoes to retain their valuable genetic resources. \u00a9 2016 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group.",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "over the last 200. years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (r&d). transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. the oldest form of r&d, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. international provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. the situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. the implementation of the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (abs) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for r&d purposes. many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning abs regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. this is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating r&d. \u00a9 2014 the authors.",

                "abstracttext": "although the publication of the vascular flora of the caribbean islands of trinidad and tobago extended from 1928\u20131992, it is incomplete with the family poaceae still outstanding. many of the early recorded families are in need of extensive revision. therefore, this checklist is intended to fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive list of the vascular plants for the islands. we compiled the checklist using the results from herbarium records, literature citations, online resources and a rapid botanic survey (rbs) of 240 sample plots across the islands. from the rbs plots 22,500 vascular plant specimens were collected, yielding 1530 species. the herbarium records, literature citations and the rbs plots yielded a total of 3639 species, of which 2407 are indigenous, 1222 are exotic and 108 are endemic or near endemic. the low endemism is attributed to the islands\u2019 close proximity to and recent separation from the south american continent. a total of 262 species of grasses (poaceae) is published here for the first time along with the results from the rbs plots. our annotated checklist further presents two types of conservation rating: the international union for the conservation of nature red list categories and a global star rating system. based on the clustering of the \u2018star rating\u2019 of each species, plant communities in the following areas: the heights of aripo, parts of the nariva swamp and the north-west islands were identified as \u2018hot spots\u2019 of high conservation value which should continue to, or receive greater protection in the national parks and protected areas system established in trinidad and tobago \u00a9 2016 magnolia press.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "over the past decade, a series of controversies has arisen about equity and justice in the rooibos industry, centred both on the biological resource and on the traditional use and knowledge that fostered the growth of this lucrative trade. accusations of biopiracy, meaning the misappropriation and patenting of genetic resources and knowledge without consent, have taken centre stage, leading to a reassessment of the conditions under which rooibos is traded. claiming to be the primary holders of traditional knowledge relating to rooibos, indigenous san and khoi have also launched demands\u2014to date unmet\u2014for a stake in rooibos benefits. meanwhile, small-scale coloured rooibos producers, despite their involvement in fair trade, remain marginalized. all remain embedded in a political history of rooibos that is characterized by dispossession and adversity, having been propped up by the south african apartheid system. the melding of these issues with a complex and ambiguous legal framework has led to a situation described by some as \u201cthe mother\u201d and \u201ctesting ground\u201d of so-called access and benefit sharing. such approaches stem in part from the convention on biological diversity and its nagoya protocol, which lay down new and more equitable ways of treating trade in genetic resources and the use of traditional knowledge. with growing international interest in rooibos tea and its bioactive compounds, a surge of patents associated with the plant, the successful granting of geographical indication status, and threats to the industry of changing climates, ecologies and ecosystems, the stage is set for a reconceptualization and transformation of the industry. drawing on longitudinal research over the past 20 years, this review paper aims to bring conceptual clarity and a holistic analysis to an often emotional, divided and, to date, narrowly framed debate. through exploration of rooibos histories and traditional knowledge claims, bioprospecting and patent activities, and conservation imperatives, this paper reviews the spectrum of issues that require attention when considering access and benefit sharing in the rooibos industry and provides suggestions for a more integrative, environmentally responsive and just approach. \u00a9 2016 saab",
