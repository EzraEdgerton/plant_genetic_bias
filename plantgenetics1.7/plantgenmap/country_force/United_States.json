                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "while cocoa plants regenerated from cryopreserved somatic embryos can demonstrate high levels of phenotypic variability, little is known about the sources of the observed variability. previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. to achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using methylation sensitive amplified polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in ln. furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible. the outcome of this study indicates that the cryopreservation induced phenotypic variability could be, at least partially, due to dna methylation changes. key message: phenotypic variability observed in cryostored cocoa somatic-embryos is epigenetic in nature. this variability is partially reversible, not stochastic in nature but a directed response to the in-vitro culture and cryopreservation. \u00a9 2016 adu-gyamfi et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "populations of the large-flowered sandwort (arenaria grandiflora l.) in the fontainebleau forest (france) have declined rapidly during the last century. despite the initiation of a protection program in 1991, less than twenty individuals remained by the late 1990s. the low fitness of these last plants, which is likely associated with genetic disorders and inbreeding depression, highlighted the need for the introduction of non-local genetic material to increase genetic diversity and thus restore fontainebleau populations. consequently, a. grandiflora was introduced at three distant sites in the fontainebleau forest in 1999. each of these populations was composed of an identical mix of individuals of both local and non-local origin that were obtained through in vitro multiplication. after establishment, the population status (number of individuals, diameter of the plants, and number of flowers) of the introduced populations was monitored. at present, two populations (one of which is much larger than the other) persist, while the third one became extinct in 2004. analyses of the ecological parameters of the introduction sites indicated that differences in soil ph and moisture might have contributed to the differences in population dynamics. this introduction plan and its outcome attracted interest of local community, with those who supported the plan and regarded its 10-year result as a biological success (i.e., persistent populations were created), but also those who expressed reservations or disapproval of the plan and its outcome. to understand this controversy, a sociological study involving 27 semi-structured interviews was carried out. from these interviews emerged three areas of controversy: alteration of the identity of the plant, alteration of the identity of its territory, and the biological and ethical consequences of the techniques used for the experimental conservation. \u00a9 2013 maurice et al.",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "polyploidy has rarely been documented in rain forest trees but it has recently been found in african species of the genus afzelia (leguminosae), which is composed of four tetraploid rain forest species and two diploid dry forest species. the genus afzelia thus provides an opportunity to examine how and when polyploidy and habitat shift occurred in africa, and whether they are associated. in this study, we combined three plastid markers (psba, trnl, ndhf), two nuclear markers (ribosomal its and the single-copy pepc e7 gene), plastomes (obtained by high throughput sequencing) and morphological traits, with an extensive taxonomic and geographic sampling to explore the evolutionary history of afzelia. both nuclear dna and morphological vegetative characters separated diploid from tetraploid lineages. although the two african diploid species were well differentiated genetically and morphologically, the relationships among the tetraploid species were not resolved. in contrast to the nuclear markers, plastid markers revealed that one of the diploid species forms a well-supported clade with the tetraploids, suggesting historical hybridisation, possibly in relation with genome duplication (polyploidization) and habitat shift from dry to rain forests. molecular dating based on fossil-anchored gene phylogenies indicates that extant afzelia started diverging c. 14.5 or 20 ma while extant tetraploid species started diverging c. 7.0 or 9.4 ma according to plastid and nuclear dna, respectively. additional studies of tropical polyploid plants are needed to assess whether the ploidy-habitat association observed in african afzelia would reflect a role of polyploidization in niche divergence in the tropics. \u00a9 2016 elsevier inc.",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "there is a growing call for inventories that evaluate geographic patterns in diversity of plant genetic resources maintained on farm and in species' natural populations in order to enhance their use and conservation. such evaluations are relevant for useful tropical and subtropical tree species, as many of these species are still undomesticated, or in incipient stages of domestication and local populations can offer yet-unknown traits of high value to further domestication. for many outcrossing species, such as most trees, inbreeding depression can be an issue, and genetic diversity is important to sustain local production. diversity is also crucial for species to adapt to environmental changes. this paper explores the possibilities of incorporating molecular marker data into geographic information systems (gis) to allow visualization and better understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity as a key input to optimize conservation and use of plant genetic resources, based on a case study of cherimoya (annona cherimola mill.), a neotropical fruit tree species. we present spatial analyses to (1) improve the understanding of spatial distribution of genetic diversity of cherimoya natural stands and cultivated trees in ecuador, bolivia and peru based on microsatellite molecular markers (ssrs); and (2) formulate optimal conservation strategies by revealing priority areas for in situ conservation, and identifying existing diversity gaps in ex situ collections. we found high levels of allelic richness, locally common alleles and expected heterozygosity in cherimoya's putative centre of origin, southern ecuador and northern peru, whereas levels of diversity in southern peru and especially in bolivia were significantly lower. the application of gis on a large microsatellite dataset allows a more detailed prioritization of areas for in situ conservation and targeted collection across the andean distribution range of cherimoya than previous studies could do, i.e. at province and department level in ecuador and peru, respectively. \u00a9 2012 van zonneveld et al.",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "while cocoa plants regenerated from cryopreserved somatic embryos can demonstrate high levels of phenotypic variability, little is known about the sources of the observed variability. previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. to achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using methylation sensitive amplified polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in ln. furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible. the outcome of this study indicates that the cryopreservation induced phenotypic variability could be, at least partially, due to dna methylation changes. key message: phenotypic variability observed in cryostored cocoa somatic-embryos is epigenetic in nature. this variability is partially reversible, not stochastic in nature but a directed response to the in-vitro culture and cryopreservation. \u00a9 2016 adu-gyamfi et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "background: accurate identification of crop cultivars is crucial in assessing the impact of crop improvement research outputs. two commonly used identification approaches, elicitation of variety names from farmer interviews and morphological plant descriptors, have inherent uncertainty levels. genotyping-by-sequencing (gbs) was used in a case study as an alternative method to track released varieties in farmers' fields, using cassava, a clonally propagated root crop widely grown in the tropics, and often disseminated through extension services and informal seed systems. a total of 917 accessions collected from 495 farming households across ghana were genotyped at 56,489 snp loci along with a \"reference library\" of 64 accessions of released varieties and popular landraces. results: accurate cultivar identification and ancestry estimation was accomplished through two complementary clustering methods: (i) distance-based hierarchical clustering; and (ii) model-based maximum likelihood admixture analysis. subsequently, 30 % of the identified accessions from farmers' fields were matched to specific released varieties represented in the reference library. admixture analysis revealed that the optimum number of major varieties was 11 and matched the hierarchical clustering results. the majority of the accessions (69 %) belonged purely to one of the 11 groups, while the remaining accessions showed two or more ancestries. further analysis using subsets of snp markers reproduced results obtained from the full-set of markers, suggesting that gbs can be done at higher dna multiplexing, thereby reducing the costs of variety fingerprinting. a large proportion of discrepancy between genetically unique cultivars as identified by markers and variety names as elicited from farmers were observed. clustering results from admixture analysis was validated using the assumption-free discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc) method. conclusion: we show that genome-wide snp markers from increasingly affordable gbs methods coupled with complementary cluster analysis is a powerful tool for fine-scale population structure analysis and variety identification. moreover, the ancestry estimation provides a framework for quantifying the contribution of exotic germplasm or older improved varieties to the genetic background of contemporary improved cultivars. \u00a9 2015 rabbi et al.",

                "abstracttext": "fluctuating asymmetry (fa), i.e. small, non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in morphological characters, increases under genetic and/or environmental stress. ecological and evolutionary studies addressing fa became popular in past decades; however, their outcomes remain controversial. the discrepancies might be at least partly explained by inconsistent and non-standardised methodology. our aim was to improve the methodology of these studies by identifying factors that affect the reproducibility of fa measurements in plant leaves. six observers used a highly standardised measurement protocol to measure fa using the width, area and weight of the same set of leaves of 10 plant species that differed in leaf size, shape of the leaf margin and other leaf traits. on average, 24% of the total variation in the data was due to measurement error. reproducibility of measurements varied with the shape of leaf margin, leaf size, the measured character and the experience of the observer. the lowest reproducibility of the width of leaf halves was found for simple leaves with serrate margins and the highest for simple leaves with entire margins and for compound pinnate leaves. the reproducibility was significantly lower for the weight of leaf halves than for either their width or area, especially for plants with small leaves. the reproducibility was also lower for measurements made by experienced observers than by na\u00efve observers. the size of press-dried leaves decreased slightly but significantly relative to fresh leaves, but the fa of press-dried leaves adequately reflected the fa of fresh leaves. in contrast, preservation in 60% ethanol did not affect leaf size, but it decreased the width-based values of fa to 89.3% of the values measured from fresh leaves. we suggest that although reproducibility of leaf fa measurements depends upon many factors, the shape of the leaf margin is the most important source of variation. we recommend, whenever possible, choosing large-leaved plants with entire leaf margins as model objects for studies involving measurements of fa using the width of leaf halves. these measurements should be conducted with high accuracy from images of fresh or press-dried leaves. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",
