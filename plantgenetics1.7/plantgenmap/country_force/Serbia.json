                "abstracttext": "the last resort for conservation of rare tree populations in refugial areas under high risk of climate driven extinction may be ex situ conservation and assisted translocation. although such actions require detailed knowledge about the spatial scale and heterogeneity of the within-population distribution of genetic diversity, it is still unknown whether fine-scale spatial genetic structure (fsgs) is present in refugial populations of forest trees. in order to address this issue, we carried out the first whole-population genetic characterisation of a small and isolated refugial population of the iucn red-listed serbian spruce [picea omorika (pan\u010d.) purk.] from the balkans. all 418 adult individuals were georeferenced and genotyped at nuclear est-ssrs and at a mitochondrial (mtdna) locus. spatial autocorrelation analyses provided only a simplified description of fsgs, which is concordant with findings in wind-pollinated species with limited seed dispersal. however, bayesian analysis revealed three heterogeneous, highly differentiated (pairwise g\u2019st &gt; 0.3), and spatially localised sub-populations showing only partial overlap with the distribution of mtdna haplotypes. such complex structure in only 0.34 ha, resulting mainly from historical events, restrictions to gene flow and high local density, was undetected in previous work based on more traditional sampling schemes for population genetics surveys. we demonstrate the usefulness of sampling schemes leaning towards a whole-population genetic characterisation in mining the finest characteristics of fsgs, and argue that our understanding of genetic structuring in highly heterogeneous refugial regions at both macro- and micro-scales is still rather limited and often oversimplified. this has severe implications on conservation of plant biodiversity from these regions in terms of responses to global climate change. \u00a9 2017 springer science+business media dordrecht",

                "abstracttext": "dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l., lamiaceae) is a well-known aromatic and medicinal mediterranean plant that is native in coastal regions of the western balkan and southern apennine peninsulas and is commonly cultivated worldwide. it is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. knowledge of its genetic diversity and spatiotemporal patterns is important for plant breeding programmes and conservation. we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivated/naturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula. the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivated/naturalised groups, with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area. most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations, although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance. geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis, with three sub-clusters of indigenous populations. the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast, while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula. the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary trajectories: 1) the species survived in the glacial refugium in southern adriatic coastal region with subsequent colonization events towards northern, eastern and southern balkan peninsula; 2) species survived in several refugia exhibiting concurrent divergence into three genetic groups. the insight into genetic diversity and structure also provide the baseline data for conservation of s. officinalis genetic resources valuable for future breeding programmes. \u00a9 2016 re\u0161etnik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

                "abstracttext": "dalmatian sage (salvia officinalis l., lamiaceae) is a well-known aromatic and medicinal mediterranean plant that is native in coastal regions of the western balkan and southern apennine peninsulas and is commonly cultivated worldwide. it is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. knowledge of its genetic diversity and spatiotemporal patterns is important for plant breeding programmes and conservation. we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate evolutionary history of indigenous populations as well as genetic diversity and structure within and among indigenous and cultivated/naturalised populations distributed across the balkan peninsula. the results showed a clear separation between the indigenous and cultivated/naturalised groups, with the cultivated material originating from one restricted geographical area. most of the genetic diversity in both groups was attributable to differences among individuals within populations, although spatial genetic analysis of indigenous populations indicated the existence of isolation by distance. geographical structuring of indigenous populations was found using clustering analysis, with three sub-clusters of indigenous populations. the highest level of gene diversity and the greatest number of private alleles were found in the central part of the eastern adriatic coast, while decreases in gene diversity and number of private alleles were evident towards the northwestern adriatic coast and southern and eastern regions of the balkan peninsula. the results of ecological niche modelling during last glacial maximum and approximate bayesian computation suggested two plausible evolutionary trajectories: 1) the species survived in the glacial refugium in southern adriatic coastal region with subsequent colonization events towards northern, eastern and southern balkan peninsula; 2) species survived in several refugia exhibiting concurrent divergence into three genetic groups. the insight into genetic diversity and structure also provide the baseline data for conservation of s. officinalis genetic resources valuable for future breeding programmes. \u00a9 2016 re\u0161etnik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",
