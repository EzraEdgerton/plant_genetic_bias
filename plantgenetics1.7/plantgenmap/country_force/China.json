                "abstracttext": "it is challenging and interesting to establish a precise dynamic model of an otb (once-through boiler) power plant unit in order to meet large scale load demands from the power grid. this study proposes to establish such a dynamic mathematical model of an ultra-supercritical otb unit under dry operating conditions. more precisely, the dynamic model structure was derived from mass and energy conservation laws as well as thermodynamic principles under some reasonable simplifications and assumptions. then an iga (immune genetic algorithm) was improved to identify the parameters, combined with running data. after this, to further enhance model performance, the dynamic mathematical model was extended to be the one with different sets of parameters and functions under different monotonous load ranges. additionally, open- and closed-loop experiments were conducted in order to further validate the developed model. the experimental results show that the model outputs can approach the actual running data over a wide operating range with appropriate accuracy. more importantly, the dynamic model captures the essential dynamic characteristics of the unit. therefore, the model can be feasible and applicable for simulation analysis and testing control algorithms. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ltd",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "seed longevity, the maintenance of viability during storage, is a major factor for conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity. seed longevity is an important trait of agriculture crop and is impaired by reactive oxygen species (ros) during seed desiccation, storage and germination (c. r. biol., 331, 2008 and 796). seeds possess a wide range of systems (protection, detoxification, repair) allowing them to survive during storage and to preserve a high germination ability. in many plants, 1-cys peroxiredoxin (1-cys prx, also named per1) is a seed-specific antioxidant which eliminates ros with cysteine residues. here we identified and characterized a seed-specific per1 protein from seeds of sacred lotus (nelumbo nucifera gaertn.). purified nnper1 protein protects dna against the cleavage by ros in the mixed-function oxidation system. the transcription and protein accumulation of nnper1 increased during seed desiccation and imbibition and under abiotic stress treatment. ectopic expression of nnper1 in arabidopsis enhanced the seed germination ability after controlled deterioration treatment (cdt), indicating that nnper1 improves seed longevity of transgenic plants. consistent with the function of nnper1 on detoxifying ros, we found that the level of ros release and lipid peroxidation was strikingly lower in transgenic seeds compared to wild-type with or without cdt. furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis seeds ectopic-expressing nnper1 displayed enhanced tolerance to high temperature and abscisic acid (aba), indicating that nnper1 may participate in the thermotolerance and aba signaling pathway. \u00a9 2016 the authors the plant journal \u00a9 2016 john wiley & sons ltd",

                "abstracttext": "seed longevity, the maintenance of viability during storage, is a major factor for conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity. seed longevity is an important trait of agriculture crop and is impaired by reactive oxygen species (ros) during seed desiccation, storage and germination (c. r. biol., 331, 2008 and 796). seeds possess a wide range of systems (protection, detoxification, repair) allowing them to survive during storage and to preserve a high germination ability. in many plants, 1-cys peroxiredoxin (1-cys prx, also named per1) is a seed-specific antioxidant which eliminates ros with cysteine residues. here we identified and characterized a seed-specific per1 protein from seeds of sacred lotus (nelumbo nucifera gaertn.). purified nnper1 protein protects dna against the cleavage by ros in the mixed-function oxidation system. the transcription and protein accumulation of nnper1 increased during seed desiccation and imbibition and under abiotic stress treatment. ectopic expression of nnper1 in arabidopsis enhanced the seed germination ability after controlled deterioration treatment (cdt), indicating that nnper1 improves seed longevity of transgenic plants. consistent with the function of nnper1 on detoxifying ros, we found that the level of ros release and lipid peroxidation was strikingly lower in transgenic seeds compared to wild-type with or without cdt. furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis seeds ectopic-expressing nnper1 displayed enhanced tolerance to high temperature and abscisic acid (aba), indicating that nnper1 may participate in the thermotolerance and aba signaling pathway. \u00a9 2016 the authors the plant journal \u00a9 2016 john wiley & sons ltd",

                "abstracttext": "whitebark pine (wbp, pinus albicaulis engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (wpbr, caused by cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae). information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. however, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for wbp. in this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from wbp breeding programs in western north america. rna-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the wbp needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous snps (ns-snps). following the annotation of genes with ns-snps, 216 ns-snps within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design snp arrays for high-throughput genotyping. among these snp loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from british columbia (canada), oregon and washington (usa). a clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the wbp breeding populations. genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of wpbr disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of wbp genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to wpbr. the wbp genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines. \u00a9 this is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. the work is made available under the creative commons cc0 public domain dedication.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "background: the european food safety authority (efsa) has introduced a concept for the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified (gm) plants which foresees the definition of ecological threshold values defining acceptable adverse effects of the gm plant on the environment (limits of concern, loc). methods: we analysed the loc concept by scrutinising its feasibility with regard to important aspects of the environmental risk assessment. we then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the stepwise testing approach. we finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern. results: the loc concept is a possible approach to introduce ecological thresholds into environmental risk assessment in order to evaluate environmental harm. however, the concept leaves many important aspects open. thresholds for environmental harm for protection goals need spatial and temporal differentiation from locs used for era indicators. regionalisation of locs must be provided for as biodiversity levels and protection goals vary across the eu. further guidance is needed with respect to the consequences, in case locs are exceeded and a link needs to be established between environmentally relevant results from the comparative safety assessment and the loc concept. locs for long-term effects have to be evaluated by long-term monitoring. locs for non-target organisms need to be discriminated according to the species and parameters assessed. conclusions: the overall loc concept is considered useful if locs are further specified and differentiated. although locs will finally be determined by political decisions, they should be based on scientific grounds in order to increase confidence in the conclusions on the safety of gm plants. \u00a9 2017, the author(s).",

                "abstracttext": "although the publication of the vascular flora of the caribbean islands of trinidad and tobago extended from 1928\u20131992, it is incomplete with the family poaceae still outstanding. many of the early recorded families are in need of extensive revision. therefore, this checklist is intended to fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive list of the vascular plants for the islands. we compiled the checklist using the results from herbarium records, literature citations, online resources and a rapid botanic survey (rbs) of 240 sample plots across the islands. from the rbs plots 22,500 vascular plant specimens were collected, yielding 1530 species. the herbarium records, literature citations and the rbs plots yielded a total of 3639 species, of which 2407 are indigenous, 1222 are exotic and 108 are endemic or near endemic. the low endemism is attributed to the islands\u2019 close proximity to and recent separation from the south american continent. a total of 262 species of grasses (poaceae) is published here for the first time along with the results from the rbs plots. our annotated checklist further presents two types of conservation rating: the international union for the conservation of nature red list categories and a global star rating system. based on the clustering of the \u2018star rating\u2019 of each species, plant communities in the following areas: the heights of aripo, parts of the nariva swamp and the north-west islands were identified as \u2018hot spots\u2019 of high conservation value which should continue to, or receive greater protection in the national parks and protected areas system established in trinidad and tobago \u00a9 2016 magnolia press.",
