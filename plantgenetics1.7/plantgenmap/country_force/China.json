                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "one of the important antiviral genetic strategies used in crop breeding is recessive resistance. two eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e family genes, eif4e and eifiso4e, are the most common recessive resistance genes whose absence inhibits infection by plant viruses in potyviridae, carmovirus, and cucumovirus. here, we show that another eif4e family gene, ncbp, acts as a novel recessive resistance gene in arabidopsis thaliana toward plant viruses in alpha- and betaflexiviridae. we found that infection by plantago asiatica mosaic virus (plamv), a potexvirus, was delayed in ncbp mutants of a. thaliana. virus replication efficiency did not differ between an ncbp mutant and a wild type plant in single cells, but viral cell-to-cell movement was significantly delayed in the ncbp mutant. furthermore, the accumulation of triple-gene-block protein 2 (tgb2) and tgb3, the movement proteins of potexviruses, decreased in the ncbp mutant. inoculation experiments with several viruses showed that the accumulation of viruses encoding tgbs in their genomes decreased in the ncbp mutant. these results indicate that ncbp is a novel member of the eif4e family recessive resistance genes whose loss impairs viral cell-to-cell movement by inhibiting the efficient accumulation of tgb2 and tgb3. \u00a9 the author(s) 2017.",
