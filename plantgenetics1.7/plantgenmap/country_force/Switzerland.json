                "abstracttext": "polyploidy has rarely been documented in rain forest trees but it has recently been found in african species of the genus afzelia (leguminosae), which is composed of four tetraploid rain forest species and two diploid dry forest species. the genus afzelia thus provides an opportunity to examine how and when polyploidy and habitat shift occurred in africa, and whether they are associated. in this study, we combined three plastid markers (psba, trnl, ndhf), two nuclear markers (ribosomal its and the single-copy pepc e7 gene), plastomes (obtained by high throughput sequencing) and morphological traits, with an extensive taxonomic and geographic sampling to explore the evolutionary history of afzelia. both nuclear dna and morphological vegetative characters separated diploid from tetraploid lineages. although the two african diploid species were well differentiated genetically and morphologically, the relationships among the tetraploid species were not resolved. in contrast to the nuclear markers, plastid markers revealed that one of the diploid species forms a well-supported clade with the tetraploids, suggesting historical hybridisation, possibly in relation with genome duplication (polyploidization) and habitat shift from dry to rain forests. molecular dating based on fossil-anchored gene phylogenies indicates that extant afzelia started diverging c. 14.5 or 20 ma while extant tetraploid species started diverging c. 7.0 or 9.4 ma according to plastid and nuclear dna, respectively. additional studies of tropical polyploid plants are needed to assess whether the ploidy-habitat association observed in african afzelia would reflect a role of polyploidization in niche divergence in the tropics. \u00a9 2016 elsevier inc.",

                "abstracttext": "concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability have stimulated interest in development of high-yield, low-lignin trees for bioenergy. black cottonwood (populus trichocarpa) has been targeted as a potential bioenergy species due to its high productivity, but it is unclear how transgenically altered lignin biosynthesis will affect plant function. we investigated the physiology of two transgenic p. trichocarpa genotypes grown in short rotation woody cropping systems at two sites in southeastern usa: (1) mesic mountain site and (2) warmer, drier piedmont site. our results suggest that lignin is fundamental for tree growth and survival in field environments. lignin deficiency can decrease biochemical photosynthetic processes and interfere with the temperature-response of photosynthesis. significantly, hydraulic conductivity of transgenic genotypes was 15\u201325% that of wildtype trees, resulting in decreased leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance. in the piedmont, decreased hydraulic efficiency drastically reduced productivity of low-lignin genotypes by 50\u201370% relative to wildtype. transgenic trees at the mountain site recovered stem lignin concentrations to levels observed in wildtype trees, but still had severely impaired hydraulic traits, highlighting the major consequences of genetic transformation on whole-plant function. surprisingly, substantial loss of hydraulic conductivity had only minor effects on productivity at the mesic site and resulted in an alternative advantage for bioenergy systems \u2013 lower water consumption. in the hottest month (july), higher intrinsic water use efficiency resulted in total water savings of roughly 1 kg d\u22121 per transgenic tree without sacrificing productivity. decreased hydraulic conductivity could therefore be a promising trait for selection of water-efficient genotypes in populus. \u00a9 2017",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "during the past decade, the use of dna for forensic applications has been extensively implemented for plant and animal species, as well as in humans. tracing back the geographical origin of an individual usually requires genetic assignment analysis. these approaches are based on reference samples that are grouped into populations or other aggregates and intend to identify the most likely group of origin. often this grouping does not have a biological but rather a historical or political justification, such as \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. in this paper, we present a new nearest neighbour approach to individual assignment or classification within a given but potentially imperfect grouping of reference samples. this method, which is based on the genetic distance between individuals, functions better in many cases than commonly used methods. we demonstrate the operation of our assignment method using two data sets. one set is simulated for a large number of trees distributed in a 120\u00a0km by 120\u00a0km landscape with individual genotypes at 150 snps, and the other set comprises experimental data of 1221 individuals of the african tropical tree species entandrophragma cylindricum (sapelli) genotyped at 61 snps. judging by the level of correct self-assignment, our approach outperformed the commonly used frequency and bayesian approaches by 15% for the simulated data set and by 5\u20137% for the sapelli data set. our new approach is less sensitive to overlapping sources of genetic differentiation, such as genetic differences among closely-related species, phylogeographic lineages and isolation by distance, and thus operates better even for suboptimal grouping of individuals. \u00a9 2016 elsevier ireland ltd",

                "abstracttext": "the colonization of land by plants shaped the terrestrial biosphere, the geosphere and global climates. the nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. in the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. in the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophyteswere an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. the data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. \u00a9 2016 the author(s).",
