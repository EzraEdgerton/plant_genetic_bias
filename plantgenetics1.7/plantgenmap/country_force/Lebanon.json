                "abstracttext": "this paper targets the process of optimizing the operation of a pv-battery backup system under intermittent grid electricity supply. a predictive scheduling layer is developed as a part of a complete load management process. the main objective of the study is to ensure a permanent power supply for a high energy consuming residential application. the control algorithm plans the activation of predictable loads 24 h ahead through compromising between a decrease in the resulting discomfort levels and the conservation of a high autonomy of the system. the strength of the developed control lies in ensuring the complete coordination between all the components of the installation: the grid, pv panels, battery storage, and the load demand. no loss of power supply is allowed during the day and realistic and technical constraints are applied. the demand side management program is formulated as a multi-objective optimization algorithm solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (nsga-ii) technique. a fuzzy logic decision maker is developed for an automatic trade-off process implementing the residents' preferences. the simulation results show excellent performance and flexibility of the proposed algorithm. the benefits of the load management are proved to have a great impact on the backup installation sizing, which leads to notable reduction of its price. \u00a9 2015 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",

                "abstracttext": "background: the fungal genus aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. the genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. results: we have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. this revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. a genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. conclusions: many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. the comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi. \u00a9 2017 the author(s).",
